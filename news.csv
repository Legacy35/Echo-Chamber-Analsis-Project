"I'm still in law school and even I know a bad brief when I see one. Does it even get into statutory interpretation anywhere? I think that's such a strained reading of that statute. First, does ""the option to accept or refuse"" apply narrowly to whether the FDA can create a mandate, or should it be more broadly interpreted to mean any employers? Given the context of the language and that the statute delineates the Secretary's responsibilities in regards to an emergency, it seems like the former. Moreover, if it *is* the latter, what do you do if a private nursing home wants to mandate the vaccine? Now a statute that was intended to delegate responsibilities to the Secretary in the event of a crisis is being read to usurp policy decisions by employers? No way. Second, there's the consequences portion of the statute. Of course whether that means health consequences or broader is up for debate, but given that it follows ""the option to accept or refuse,"" it's not a stretch to read that more broadly.

"Hmmm that perhaps gets it a bit more nasty. Like if you resell something you modified as your own thing and can get sued if the company who made the base object for it doesn't like the results, that can set dangerous precedents. It would essentially mean you don't really own a physical object that you buy and that's really nasty but probably a wet dream for any company selling such an object.


I know for instance you can make and sell your own Lego sets as long as you keep the brand name off of everything like the box or the instructions (not sure if you're allowed to mention it contains actual Lego pieces as opposed to knockoffs but I am sure the community has an exact answer for this).

It could of course be smarter to go with ""most people are idiots so make sure even idiots understand it's not Nike's idea"" but that would be very unfair because then it would only make sense to go the other way around and make most advertising and packaging design in general illegal because it specifically relies on ""most people"" buying based on assumptions. Do when they get sued they bring in a ""reasonable person"" who isn't s dumbass who of course sees through the bullshit and they're off the hook.

Actually yeah if all advertising and such had to be made with the idea that if someone misunderstood something due to design, it is false advertising then we would finally be able to have advertising that's very informative and specific.

"What makes some vaccines required, while other vaccines not required?  I know it is up to the state to decide which vaccines, but I'm not sure the priority chosen.  

I don't know of any schools that require you to get a flu vaccine and other vaccines like that.  I would suspect that it would have to do with how ""dangerous"" (which is a very broad and up for interpretation meaning) whatever the entity you are vaccinating against would be.

For example, Texas only requires the Meningococcal vaccine (for college) as a statewide minimum, but it seems colleges themselves have more requirements like MMR, Hepatitis, TB, etc.  I would imagine that the R0 is a factor, which for MMR is really high (&gt; 10), and Hepatitis B is around 5-7 (from what I read).  So it makes sense those really infectious diseases are vaccinated against when you live that close to others.  

From what I could fine, Meningococcal R0 is around 1.3, but not sure that is right.  If so, it must be the severity of Meningitis is the reasoning instead of the secondary infection rate.  The flu has an R0 of 1-2, and  COVID-19 is around 2-3 (hard to find a good measurement as it seems to vary a lot by source).  

The flu vaccine isn't required to attend college, so it is interesting to see that COVID-19 vaccine is being pushed to be required.  I suspect the highly politicized nature of it has a hand in that.  While it can be deadlier than the flu to people at risk, generally college students wouldn't be those people.  It would make sense to provide and maybe require the staff to get vaccinated as they would be more likely in the risk group than students.

FWIW, I am not against the idea, but am just curious since comparatively it doesn't seem quite as serious as some other vaccine requirements unless you factor in the politicization that comes with the COVID-19 name, sadly.",1618000250.0,gtyzqmt,t3_mngdhr,/r/news/comments/mngdhr/us_colleges_will_require_students_to_be/gtyzqmt/,1.0,1618014650.0,"vaccines, state, priority, schools, flu, vaccine, interpretation, meaning, entity, example, t3_mngdhr, college, minimum, colleges, requirements, factor, gt, sense, diseases, others, severity, reasoning, infection, rate, R0, COVID-19, measurement, lot, source, nature, hand, people, risk, students, staff, group, idea, politicization, name",0.6053230158730157,0.027599783549783544,0.0

"The number was more a generalization based off different stats I’ve seen across multiple studies. I feel it’s pretty common knowledge though the work culture in America regularly puts pressure on its employees to go above and beyond what would normally be expected. 

I’ve worked multiple jobs in the same industry and each company would regularly stress meeting ridiculous quotas and deadlines to all its employees including myself. I don’t know a single full-timer I worked with that worked less than 60 hours a week and many at one point or another described their situation as “the norm” when comparing to their past employment. 

The kicker was some of these places were even required by law to only allow workers a designated amount of hours a week but it seemed pretty easy for them to find ways of circumnavigating that issue if they wanted to.

One of the big reasons (IMO) for the high turn over at Amazon FCs is the fact they they are crappy boring jobs with little potential for career growth.

"From the second source:

&gt;	Using a method capable of measuring both of the 3-methylfentanyl isomers, a report on an epidemic of 3-methylfentanyl fatalities in Estonia (Ojanperä et al. (2008)) stated that the average combined concentration of the isomers was — at 1.9 ng/ml — approximately 10 times lower than the concentrations found in Canadian and US fatalities attributed solely to fentanyl (ranging from 17–25 ng/ml) (Hull et al. (2007), Martin et al. (2006).

It appears normal fentanyl is fatal at around 17-25 ng/mL, with it being lower when mixed with other drugs (the bit about polypharmacy earlier in the link). However, there are more potent non-pharmaceutical fentanyls that can apparently kill at an average of 1.9ng/mL.

"&gt;It's not antivax, its questioning the long term safety which is unknown. Some people dont eat meat unless they know it's not factory farmed. Does that mean they are vegetarian? No. They just dont eat meat is they dont have enough information on it.

It depends. In most cases, though, they’re perfectly fine with other technologies which are less than 20 years old. 5G is new. Are they also concerned with 5G signals? If not, it seems the concern is solely vaccine related. Which would make them anti-vaccine. 

If in your example the person would eat only known beef but eat any pork, we would conclude the issue is not information related. 

&gt;If I'm a 20-something in good health, me worrying about the long term effects of a vaccine is a valid concern versus a virus that for the most what would be a bad cold.

We know little more about the long-term effects of the virus, and what information we have indicates worse long-term effects. 

&gt;That's not to say I wont get it when older, or when there is more data available demonstrating the long term effects. It's not an anti-vax stance, it's a show me the data stance which they cannot do.

Again, show me the data on 5G or any other technology which is less than 20 years old. If they’re using solely technology from the 90’s, fine, but otherwise they’re being inconsistent.

"&gt;it is not easy to relocate an Amazon built warehouse. 


That's true but not a hard as you'd think.  Amazon doesn't own the vast majority of their warehouses, they lease them from developers. The big reason for this is because they'd rather not be in the property owning business (since that isn't a core competency) and would rather invest in things that are. While they do sign long term leases they can 'walk away' from a facility much easier than if they owned it and pumped a couple hundred million into developing it. This gives them way more flexibility than say a car company who needs to build their own specialized facilities for their needs, effectively locking them into that space for a long period of time.",1617999138.0,gtyxczj,t1_gtyvb8w,/r/news/comments/mnjd1e/amazon_employees_vote_not_to_unionize_giving_big/gtyxczj/,1.0,1618013538.0,"gt;it, t1_gtyvb8w, warehouse, majority, warehouses, developers, reason, property, business, core, competency, things, term, leases, facility, couple, way, flexibility, car, company, facilities, needs, space, period, time",0.61875,0.2232638888888889,0.0

"The man was innocent.

Here is your defense if the prosecutor - he was incapable of accepting the truth and harnessed the power of the state through a very deliberate process to steal another person’s life. Because that prosecutor believed his own theory of the crime was more important than the truth. 

The man was innocent and yet the prosecutor pursued him and convinced a jury of something that was factually incorrect. Being stubborn and obstinate is not a defense. 

Securing a guilty verdict require a ton of effort. It is inordinately pre-meditated. It requires a person to consider possible defenses like “he didn’t do it” and figure out why those defenses are wrong. But if that specific defense is not wrong - as in this case where he didn’t do it - then something happened. Something bad. And you suggesting that a prosecutor’s stubbornness somehow excuses this is just plain wrong.

Your article covers almost exactly what I was talking about. It surely can isolate to South Carolinian (non-union) Boeing machinists to Seattle-area (union) machinists.

But the problem with doing this is that even doing that does not indicate that if South Carolinian Boeing machinists were to unionize that they would make 20% more. The reason being that Boeing located there specifically to be non-union. If that area becomes union, they'll just open another plant elsewhere which is still non-union. And then the jobs in South Carolina will decline and be eliminated.

So you can again see that even if statistically union jobs make more it does not mean that an individual's job becomes unionized that that individual will make more.

"&gt; How does it show itself in society? 

In 2016, a study found 40% of medical students believed black people had thicker skin and higher pain tolerances. This is linked to the phenomena where black patients have their pain rated as lower by medical professionals, and thus addressed as less severe.

That's just one little facet that has to do specifically with health.

But if you really wanna dig into it, we can get serious and talk about the heaps of high population density, high poverty density, majority black areas in the US, and how we got to this situation.

"&gt;This is especially hilarious to accuse someone of in the same conversation as you argue a lever action is as effective as a semi auto rifle.

Because calibers function the same regardless of the action type you use lol. Lever actions are surprisingly fast, and a box mag-fed lever actions functional capability for damage is on par with a semi-automatic if you're talking about short-medium range. Mag-dumping is not really a useful tactic.

&gt;Okay, well since you want to stick to ""because the constitution says so"" I'm going to hold you to it. Why are black people 3/5ths of a person?

Idk why you keep bringing up the constitution. The constitution simply codified the right, the right exists regardless of the constitution. But if you want to bring up black people, all gun control is racist both in its historical and current applications.

&gt;Not really. 100,000 iraqis dead, 300,000 wounded. ~4000 US military dead, ~6000 wounded.

You should look at the Vietnam numbers as well. Number of dead doesn't equate to victory.

&gt;Okay, well that's good because the US military has lots of artillery too.

Yeah and not a whole lot of places in the US to deploy it. Artillery isn't that effective in urban environments unless you don't care about collateral damage. Which, if the US is dropping arty on its own civilians, then they have kind of justified a civil war to begin with lol.

"A lot of these comments are people saying things about colleges always requiring you to be vaccinated as if these covid vaccines have been deemed safe. 

The problem is they are still being tested, and you can’t expect everyone who wants to attend college to be on board with putting something new and only short term tested into their bodies. 

It feels like a step in the wrong direction and a violation of human rights to tell someone they are required to partake in the biggest human experiment if they want to live a “normal” life. 

Shaming people who err on the side of caution is non-productive and unless they can prove there are no long-term negative effects as they have with previous vaccines (by testing them long term) it will only isolate and divide more people.

"&gt; You literally picked an example that proves my point with Kale.

You don't understand your point then.

&gt; Kale actually contains bile acid sequestrants (literally the same thing used in medication to lower cholesterol), which can lower cholesterol levels.

Can is an interesting word.

&gt; Meaning if you eat Kale you are going to help lower your cholesterol.

Beginning to eat kale is not necessarily going to lower your cholesterol. It may ""help lower your cholesterol"" but that does not mean your cholesterol number goes down to be like the other group. It doesn't meant it goes down at all.

&gt; Your argument at the moment is literally ""Stats don't matter unless they support my point"".

No. It is not at all.

The point is that stats measure groups. There can be correlations in those groups, but changing one thing about an individual in one group, even the thing which you used to separate the groups, does not necessarily transform that individual into a person who is in the other group.

And this is the case with unionization.

I made my point quite well. If you actually have something to say about how union machinist jobs and non-union machinist jobs only differ in the unionization then there is plenty of space below for you to make your case.

As opposed to what? You're lying to yourself if you think most workplaces are entirely meritocratic. At least with seniority the bosses nephew doesn't get promoted to manager when they've only worked there for a month.

&gt; almost impossible to fire people.

Proof?? Seems like the union just defends its members and enforces a process that forces an employer to justify its actions. If an employer is too lazy to do so that's not the union- that's your employer.

Umm...? Yeah of course you pay dues. You also get a lot of stuff from that. The unionized kitchen I was a part of got me breaks, and a higher wage plus raises every 6 months. Not things you often see in this industry.

yeah you got me there. But honestly I still blame the employer for putting all sorts of pressure on people.

"Copying one of the most upvoted comments from /r/hiphopheads that really captures my thoughts on the person he was, I don't think anybody's claiming the man was a saint;

What I loved about X, that I didn't even fully realise until I was older, was his vulnerability. Obviously everyone knows 'X Gon Give It To Ya' DMX, but his earliest albums had such raw honesty in them. X has never been a supremely complex lyricist, but what he lacked in vocabulary he more than made up for with authenticity. 

In that way, X has always reminded me of Johnny Cash. Both outlaws, both devout men of God living lives with sin. Both struggled with addiction and fame. Both walking contradictions. But above all, both of them unafraid to show the world their fears and anxieties; that courage really meant a lot to people like me, growing up angry at authority and the world in general.

I'm not going to pretend X was the greatest guy. He did a lot of shit that I think is reprehensible, and his lyricism could at times range from distasteful to abhorrent. X wasn't some misunderstood saint; he was an incredibly flawed man, and those flaws haunted him throughout this entire life. He wanted to change, and were it not for his demons, I truly think that he could have. Addiction is an evil, nefarious devil to live with.

In spite of this, the biggest thing I'll take away from DMX is that since I was a kid, he taught me that vulnerability does not equal weakness, that contradiction is human nature, and that life is a never ending journey that can swallow you whole if you let it. I think that the best thing fans of X can do, is do their best to avoid the traps that he got caught in. If you are struggling with addiction or mental illness, please do what you can to seek support for it.

You understand money raised via taxes pay for literally every beneficial thing the government does.  You know, like the free vaccine so you don’t die from the pandemic that’s currently ravaging the world.

&gt;	Some people want a big government with security but no freedom 

Conservatism has nothing to do with liberty.  How does deciding health care policy based on religion increase freedom?  How does vilifying sexual minorities increase freedom?

&gt;	For you democratic policies are preferable so you think everybody should think the same

You clearly have no understanding of what I believe.  I doubt you even understand what *you* believe in a philosophically consistent manner.

&gt;	However, this is not the case as I have explained you shouldn’t pretend someone having different values means they are stupid or ignorant or voting against themselves.

DMX, 37, whose real name is Earl Simmons, faces seven misdemeanor animal cruelty charges and four felony drug possession charges, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.
He was apprehended at his home in Cave Creek, Arizona. A news release from the office also said deputies were serving a search warrant at the Mayo Clinic in nearby Scottsdale, Arizona, involving possible fraud charges involving the rapper.

According to sheriff's deputies, five pit bull mix puppies were taken from the rapper's home by an animal control unit and will be taken to to a jail where they will be cared for by female inmates.

In August, deputies raided DMX's home and seized 12 pit bulls and pit bull mixes after receiving a report that the animals were being abused. No arrests were made at the time; authorities said that some of the dogs had apparently not been fed or watered but that there was no evidence of dogfighting.

&gt;DMX was first sent to prison in 1986 after stealing a dog from a junkyard. He was sentenced to two years in the juvenile unit of Woodfield Prison in Valhalla, New York. However, just weeks after starting his sentence, he and his cellmate successfully escaped the prison and DMX returned home to New York until his mother forced him to turn himself in and finish his sentence, which he did at the McCormick Juvenile Detention Centre in Brooktondale, New York.\[1\] Simmons was sent to prison again in 1988 for carjacking, and was later moved to a higher security prison after attempting to extort a fellow inmate for drugs. He was released in the summer of 1988.\[1\]  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Since becoming a public figure, DMX's multiple arrests have been for offenses including: resisting arrest, animal cruelty,\[64\] reckless driving,\[65\] unlicensed driving, drug possession,\[66\] and identity falsification.\[67\]  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;1998–1999  
&gt;  
&gt;When officers of the Fort Lee Police Department executed a search of his home in 1999, DMX promptly surrendered himself on weapons possession charges.\[68\]  
&gt;  
&gt;DMX faced a 1999 animal cruelty charge in Teaneck, New Jersey after a dozen pit bulls were found at his home there;\[69\] the charge was dismissed after the performer agreed to accept responsibility and record public service announcements for an animal rights group.\[70\]  
&gt;  
&gt;2000–2005  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2000, DMX served a 15-day jail sentence for possession of marijuana.\[71\]  
&gt;  
&gt;DMX served another jail sentence in 2001 for driving without a license and possession of marijuana. His appeal to reduce the sentence was denied; rather, he was charged with assault for throwing objects at prison guards. DMX entered rehab to treat his addiction to drugs in 2002.\[72\]\[73\]  
&gt;  
&gt;In January 2002, DMX pleaded guilty in New Jersey to 13 counts of animal cruelty, two counts of maintaining a nuisance and one count each of disorderly conduct and possession of drug paraphernalia. He eventually plea-bargained down to fines, probation and community service and starred in public service announcements against the dangers of guns and animal abuse.\[74\]  
&gt;  
&gt;In June 2004, DMX was arrested at the John F. Kennedy International Airport, on charges of cocaine possession, criminal impersonation, criminal possession of a weapon, criminal mischief, menacing, and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, while claiming to be a federal agent and attempting to carjack a vehicle.\[75\] He was given a conditional discharge on December 8, 2004, but pleaded guilty on October 25, 2005, to violating parole.\[76\]  
&gt;  
&gt;On November 18, 2005, DMX was sentenced to 70 days in jail for violating parole; the lateness charge added a 10-day extension to the original 60-day sentence.\[77\] DMX was released early (for ""good behavior"") on December 30, 2005.\[78\]  
&gt;  
&gt;2008–2011  
&gt;  
&gt;On May 9, 2008, DMX was arrested on drug and animal cruelty charges after attempting to barricade himself inside his Arizona home.\[70\]  
&gt;  
&gt;DMX pleaded guilty to charges of drug possession, theft, and animal cruelty, at a hearing on December 30, 2008; he was sentenced to 90 days in jail on January 31, 2009.\[79\]\[80\]  
&gt;  
&gt;On May 22, 2009, DMX entered a plea agreement/change of plea and pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated assault.  
&gt;  
&gt;After serving four out of six months for violating drug probation, DMX was released from jail on July 6, 2010.\[81\] That day, a television pilot was filmed to portray his road to recovery; however, DMX was arrested three weeks later and the pilot did not evolve into a series.  
&gt;  
&gt;On July 27, 2010, DMX turned himself in to Los Angeles Metropolitan Court for a reckless driving charge he received in 2002. He was sentenced to serve ninety days in jail.\[82\]\[83\]  
&gt;  
&gt;On November 19, 2010, DMX was arrested in Maricopa County, Arizona on charges of violating his probation by consuming alcohol (at a performance). On December 20, 2010, DMX was moved to the Mental Health Unit of the Arizona State Prison,\[84\] and released on July 18, 2011.\[85\]  
&gt;  
&gt;On August 24, 2011, DMX was arrested for speeding, recorded as 102 miles per hour (164 km/h) in a 65-mile-per-hour (105 km/h) zone, reckless driving, and driving with a suspended license. While DMX admitted to speeding, he claims he was driving 85 miles per hour (137 km/h).\[86\]  
&gt;  
&gt;2013  
&gt;  
&gt;On February 13, 2013, DMX was arrested in Spartanburg, South Carolina for driving without a driver's license.\[87\]  
&gt;  
&gt;On July 26, 2013, DMX was arrested again in Greenville County, South Carolina and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, as well as driving without a license.\[88\]  
&gt;  
&gt;On August 20, 2013, DMX was arrested again in Greer, South Carolina during a traffic stop after a car he was a passenger in made an improper u-turn. He was arrested due to an outstanding warrant for driving under suspension. Four packages of marijuana were also found in the vehicle, and he along with the driver were cited for them.\[89\]\[90\]\[91\]  
&gt;  
&gt;On November 4, 2013, DMX was again arrested by the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport police near Greer, South Carolina after police, who were familiar with his prior arrests, noticed DMX behind the wheel of a vehicle at the terminal. DMX was booked on charges of driving under suspension, having an uninsured vehicle, and not having a licensed vehicle. He was subsequently released after spending three hours in jail.\[92\]  
&gt;  
&gt;2015  
&gt;  
&gt;On June 26, 2015, DMX was arrested in New York, charged for robbery in Newark, New Jersey, and outstanding child support.\[93\]  
&gt;  
&gt;On July 14, 2015, DMX was sentenced to 6 months in jail for failing to pay $400,000 in child support.\[94\]  
&gt;  
&gt;On December 14, 2015, an arrest warrant was issued for DMX after he missed a court hearing to address child support issues with his ex-wife Tashera Simmons and their 4 children.\[95\]  
&gt;  
&gt;2017–2019: Tax fraud conviction  
&gt;  
&gt;In July 2017, DMX was charged with 14 federal counts of tax fraud.\[96\] Federal prosecutors charged him with failing to file income tax returns from 2010 to 2015 (a period when he earned at least $2.3 million). DMX pleaded guilty to a single count of tax fraud in November 2017.\[97\] DMX was originally free pending sentencing but was remanded to jail in January 2018 after leaving a drug treatment program ordered by the court and relapsing with cocaine and Oxycodone.\[98\] In March 2018, Judge Jed S. Rakoff sentenced DMX to one year in prison followed by three years of supervised release. The court also ordered DMX to pay $2.29 million in restitution to the government.\[97\] He was released from prison on January 25, 2019.\[99\]

"The argument is even simpler; the devil you know. They know what’s what, now.

It is the intuitive decision and it is also the wrong decision.

Amazon doesn’t have to do much apart from cast “reasonable doubt” on the Union for most voters to vote in favor of protecting what they have now, crappy as it is, because there is a non-zero chance that it could get worse, and they know that despite labor protections, a big bad corporation knows the game far better than an individual worker, so there’s no **perceived** upside, at all, just downside.

"&gt;“The Chinese” is not one group. A person from north China speaks a completely different language than someone from the southern regions of China, so much so that they cannot speak to each other. 

That's not particularly true these days. Although every area has it's local dialects (some of which are derived from Mandarin, like Sichuanese, some of which are not like Wu or Minnanese) most people under the age of around 60 can speak Mandarin as it's taught in school. The Mandarin for Mandarin- putonghua- literally means ""common language"".

&gt;So yes, a Chinese person can be racist against another Chinese person.

Cantonese also make the same joke about themselves. It's called self-deprecating humour, and is something Americans seem incapable of. Oopsie, guess I did a racism against Americans there.

"I come from a very addicted family also. I go back and forth on this issue. On the one hand I don’t think classifying it as a disease like cancer is completely “correct” and I tend to think that imprecise language muddles actually talking about issues constructively, even if it’s well-intentioned.

On the other hand, whether we call it a “disease” or not seems to be at the philosophical crux of whether or not people are willing to have any compassion for the issue. And one thing we know for sure is stigma kills. Even the fact that people are arguing with me about whether it’s good to carry Narcan in an OPIOID EPIDEMIC shows that clearly. When else do we sneer are life-saving medical treatment? Even though many forms of disease also have elements of lifestyle choices behind them too, but treatment for lung-cancer or heart disease aren’t nearly so controversial. So I guess if people need to call it a disease in order to see it as worth treating at all, I’m for that.

I think a lot of the issue comes from the way we view “personal responsibility” in general. If we use that term for an issue, it seems like a lot of people take that to mean it invalidates any social responsibility we might have to people. But I think maybe a more accurate way to look at it is not “responsibility” so much as motivation. People absolutely do need internal-motivation as well as social support to overcome addiction. It simply cannot be done without both. And unfortunately internal-motivation is something you cannot cause, force or medicate people to have.

"""I'm not saying he for sure didn't intend to but to convict we need to be able to say he for sure did.""

I already mentioned in my edit that there will certainly be someone on the jury who gives Chauvin the benefit of the doubt, leading to at least a hung jury. 

""They've also painted the crowd distraction angle and discredited the police administration (who criticized his restraint) as out of touch soft cops who haven't worked the road in forever and gave plausible reasons why you may restrain someone.""

Which will certainly sway at least one juror. I'm not discounting that in any way. 

""All they need to do is get enough doubt in there and I think they've done so""

You're probably right, at least for one juror. Problem is, what was painted as justifiable behavior on the part of Chauvin is absolutely not, which is why he was fired. The simple fact of the matter is Chauvin refused to lift his knee off of Floyd's neck for 2+ minutes after a pulse was undetectable. That's not mere negligence, there's intent to harm behind those actions. How can you argue otherwise? His intent was not to remove his knee from a man's neck who did not have a pulse. He's a veteran of the force and a sober, well trained officer well in the know of what is excessive and what is not. Excessive force is a crime. Not lifting your knee off of a suspect's neck, using a maneuver typically reserved for handcuffing someone when the suspect was already handcuffed, for 2+ minutes after a pulse was undetectable is absolutely excessive.

"Perhaps you haven't lived in a house near a college campus. Often what was once a large 4 or 5 bedroom home is rented out to students who have their own bedrooms, but common living and kitchen areas. The mail is delivered in a slot in the door and falls onto the foyer floor or into a hanging basket. It's up to the residents to manage the incoming mail.  Sometimes people who move out contact the post office to set up forwarding, sometimes they don't.  Since many counties don't drop a person until after two Presidential voting cycles have been missed, there are many unverified voters on role.  Try driving through Somerville Mass, for example,.

"&gt; Anger gets a bad rap sometimes, but when life deals you a shitty hand, it can be transcendently powerful. No one understood that like DMX.

the closest store to grab a few things is whole foods and we went the other week. While checking out this very rich white couple was getting thrown out of the store by the manager for not wearing masks. The manager started filming while the guy was furious and basically spitting at him and trying to argue nothing would happen or something I could not quite make out his insane thoughts. The manager ordered them out and photographed them and their license plate. I had a bag of food in my hands or I would have started applauding.

"Lots of these headlines today, eg from AP:

&gt; Another expert says lack of oxygen, not drugs, killed Floyd

Fentanyl kills.... via lack of oxygen as well, same as neck compression. That's the method and no other. Fentanyl is used in mega-doses for surgery ranging from newborns  to 90 year olds with heart failure, specifically because it is so physiologically safe. Like other opioids, it causes unconsciousness and stops breathing, which unless the patient is on a ventilator rapidly leads to death from... lack of oxygen.

Floyd had 11 ng/mL fentanyl at autopsy, that's an irrefutable fact. That's 4X the amount that coroners routinely accept as the sole cause of death in accidental overdose. Defense will try to show that he likely swallowed a shitload of pills during the arrest, EXACTLY the same way as he did during his recent prior arrest.

By the way this witness had a bad vibe, super aggressive in her conclusions that were based entirely on cell phone videos, very defensive when challenged, went nuts when asked about a seminal Canadian study on positional asphyxia and had to be cut off via objection... just weird.

I want to raise a scenario to you. Let's say you're a cop.

They begin having medical complications, people inform you ""that man needs medical treatment!""...

...And you and your buddies obstruct attempts to treat him and continue your kneeling for another *three minutes*.

You've seen him in considerable distress. You've felt him beneath you. You've been told ""That man needs medical assistance!"" and you *double down on what you're doing that's caused him to stop breathing.*

"what sucks is he is not entirely wrong. its do 2 wrongs make a right?

it bothers me quite a bit because he is right but that sort of behavior MUST be discouraged without question.

I am honestly not sure how to resolve that. How do you punish to discourage such behavior without making the problem worse (destroying his family as well) ??

yes the other family got ruined but that is done now. how do you get justice without making it worse?

I guess it would have to be on a case by case basis. works a 9 to 5? jail on weekends for a decade? I don't know. I really don't know how that would work or what would be a valid solution.

"Sadly, not even boycotts of Chinese products will help. The CCP regime is determined to destroy Uyghur culture and other minority cultures. They don't care if Westerners don't want to buy their products anymore. They don't care if Western supply chains decouple anymore. They won't care if Western investments and companies fall - they already have their own homegrown industries. The time when economic sanctions or boycotts would work against China has already passed.

"&gt;There is so much god damn data proving masks work incredibly effectively in stopping COVID and many other viruses;

Many other viruses, sure. But that's why the flu has been essentially eliminated over this last winter but covid went absolutely rampant. You can't have it both ways where the flu goes down because people are doing their part and being responsible but covid is spiking *everywhere* because people aren't wearing masks or distancing. I get that they have different infectious rates, but my point was that the concept behind the efficacy of masks has changed now at least three times in the last year regarding *Covid*, not talking about other viruses. All of the ""experts"" were constantly flipping back and forth on whether masks worked like people said, due to varying results in data. 

&gt;please don’t spread that nonsense without first doing the research. 

You would know what I'm talking about if you did your research too.

&gt;Also Florida absolutely recently moved to reopen certain things

Florida never closed. What did they reopen? When did they reopen? Because they only just started going back up around March 23, and have gone up to a thousand more a day now than then. My question is simply, if what you say is true (your obvious biases aside) about florida ""reopening"" and then not caring about masks and masks working as efficiently as you say, then why aren't they spiking in cases? At least moreso than Michigan, who still has restrictions. Your point about Michigan is mute since they still have more restrictions than Florida and Texas, yet they are about to be at their highest ever daily case rate.

&gt;I’m honestly getting so tired of people who openly claim to not be scientists but actually spout terrible misinformation that empowers science deniers. That may not have been your intention, to support anti-science rhetoric, but you sure as hell are doing that

I'm sorry as a scientist, do you not believe the concept of data driven results? You use data ""from the last 100 years"" to promote your concept of mask efficacy, but when new data or at the very least data that challenges your previous results gets brought forward, you ignore it and call it ""anti-science""? The actual fuck?

&gt;Maybe just stop trying to guess at science to sound like you know a damn thing about it and maybe go consult a wide peer reviewed set of research or actual real scientists

I'm literally using data and facts to back up my claims, and you're sitting here saying that I'm ""guessing"" and need to learn my place. You're coming off as a real elitist prick is what you are, not just combative. ""Whether that was your intention or not"", it's definitely the outcome. You think just because your a ""scientist"" (who openly disagrees with new data simply because it challenges their view) you're better than everyone who is coming up with theories.

&gt;you are inadvertently doing just that; supporting anti science rhetoric that is killing so many fucking people around the world.

By using real world statistics and data, I'm supporting ""anti-science"" rhetoric. Gotcha. See, these are so-called ""scientists"", folks. People who come up with theories and make them out as fact, and when challenged or presented with contradicting data, denounce it as ""anti-science"". 

&gt;I can’t say I’m honestly sorry for my tone; this type of misinformation about masks “not being as effective as we thought” has just killed too many people. I can’t put up with it and be calm anymore without losing my mind.

What about the scientists who say those very same ""misinforming"" claims? Are they less of scientists because you disagree with them? I'm literally just reporting from things that I have seen and observed, and even disclaimed that I am not a scientist, I'm only listening to what some real scientists have said. You're a hypocrite.

You can’t simply claim that because you feel I’m wrong, I’m not arguing in good faith.

you, if anyone are engaging in a bad faith argument. 

My whole argument is Fauci is untrustworthy. Let’s break it down.

"I think we have a gun culture problem. It’s not just the guns, it’s not just mental health, it’s not just culture. It is the way they are intertwined. (Just to be totally clear, I am not necessarily disagreeing with you, just expanding a bit).

I completely understand where a lot of gun control people are coming from. Their arguments make sense to a certain degree. I have the same automatic reaction they do every time a major shooting happens, and my gut instinct tells me we have to reduce the number of guns and regulate types of guns. The problem is that I simply don’t think their ideas will work. 

I think that attempting to compare how other countries dealt with the guns in their countries is just a lost cause. There are things about the comparison that have some use, but a lot of people in favor of banning certain types of firearms, mandatory buybacks, etc. want to do a one-to-one comparison and say “This worked in _____ so don’t tell me it can’t work here.” I think the differences between the US and those countries are too great and in such profound ways (especially in regards to guns) that they are oversimplifying the problem.

A lot of these people seem to not know anything about firearms. They didn’t grow up around guns, they don’t know how to use a gun, they don’t understand the culture. And rather than try to understand it, they just ridicule it, which does much more harm than good. 

To be totally and completely clear, if I could snap my fingers tomorrow and reduce the totally number of guns by 95% I would. If you want to reduce the number of guns in this country, then you HAVE to understand the gun culture(s) that exist in this country and you have to convince them to change their mindset about firearms. I don’t think there is any top down approach that is going to change it.

We have different gun problems. There isn’t one. There’s the “deranged mass shooter” gun problem, theres the suicide gun problem, and there’s the inner city drug gang gun problem. We have different gun cultures, too. There’s an “overthrow the tryrannical government” culture, there’s a “hunting, survival, independent frontiersman” culture, there’s the “protect my home” culture, there’s the “street justice” gun culture, there’s a “toxic masculinity” gun culture, there’s even a Marxist gun culture. Not all of these gun cultures are problematic in my opinion. And obviously this is a Venn diagram with plenty of overlap. The overwhelming majority of gun homicides tend to come from the “street justice” gun culture, and the overwhelming majority of headline-making mass shootings come from people who view guns as an extension of masculinity and what they turn to when they feel powerless and hopeless. 

All of these different gun cultures (no matter how problematic/deadly or unproblematic/safe) contribute to the overall number of guns that are available to be used. When the country is so deeply saturated with firearms and ammo, trying to take a surgical approach to limiting who has the guns is just doomed to fail. There’s no way to effectively keep them out of the hands of the “bad guys” without drastically limiting the number of guns there are in total. And how you go about achieving that is the real problem. 

Where I find myself completely agreeing with the anti gun control crowd is that a lot of the well-meaning pro gun control folks want to impose changes in a top down way that will not significantly effect the number of people who die via firearm, but will impose significant burdens on everyone else. And more importantly it runs the risk of triggering a massive backlash. But I get it: “we have to do SOMETHING!” is a compelling and understandable reaction to a horrific mass shooting. But superficial and piecemeal changes will not have the effect they want and will just piss off a lot of gun owners who simply aren’t part of the problem. 

I guess all of this is a long winded way of me getting around to what I think is a difficult truth about guns in America. The solution to the number of guns in this country is going to be slow and bottom up changes to culture. I do think that addressing poverty, wealth inequality, ending the drug war, and investing in education and mental health services for youths would have a much bigger and greater impact on fixing the real problems.

And before somebody jumps in and says “well, I sure hope you cared about fixing these problems before it became a gun issue”, I sure as fuck did and still do. I am a super fucking liberal progressive, borderline socialist. 

So go ahead, institute more background checks, reduce magazine sizes, ban “assault” weapons (whatever they means), institute red flag laws, chip away at the problem because you feel like “we have to do something”, but what’s your answer when all of this has been instituted and we still have far more gun deaths per capita than other countries? Enjoy losing elections in the short term and moving further from making real and fundamental positive changes to our economic and cultural structures because you “had to do something”.",1617993680.0,gtylhdz,t1_gtwhbeh,/r/news/comments/mn1m5v/several_people_injured_in_shooting_in_bryan_texas/gtylhdz/,1.0,1618008080.0,"gun, culture, problem, guns, health, way, bit, lot, control, people, arguments, sense, degree, reaction, time, shooting, gut, instinct, number, types, ideas, countries, cause, things, comparison, use, favor, firearms, buybacks, _, differences, t1_gtwhbeh, ways, regards, harm, fingers, tomorrow, %, country, mindset, approach, problems, shooter, suicide, city, drug, gang, cultures, overthrow, government, hunting, survival, frontiersman, home, street, justice, masculinity, opinion, diagram, plenty, overlap, majority, homicides, headline, mass, shootings, extension, ammo, hands, guys, total, crowd, folks, changes, top, firearm, burdens, risk, backlash, effect, owners, part, truth, solution, poverty, wealth, inequality, war, education, services, youths, impact, issue, fuck, progressive, borderline, socialist, background, checks, magazine, sizes, ban, assault, weapons, flag, laws, chip, answer, deaths, capita, elections, term, structures",0.5476002688331454,0.08919725632054401,0.0

In high school circa 2004 I  saw him in the middle of the street outside an auto body shop. I was like excuse me sir are you DMX? And it was him. He wouldn’t give me an Autograph he said a picture was better than his signature. He sent me to cvs to buy a disposable camera and he almost got in the car with me but the entourage he was with wouldn’t let him. I suppose they were scared of a lawsuit if anything happened.

I was thinking of having the estate divided into 2000 shares. All shares go to a charity for emergency vet treatments for dogs.  However, the charity portion is reduced against the people listed in the ledger.  Each time a person's name is in the ledger they get one share.  If more than 2000 name entries, which is unlikely due to how much time likely remains to fill the ledger, then the estate is divided into the larger number of shares.   Right now, the liquidated 1/2000 share would probably be worth around $1,000 and increasing but it would be better for the heirs to keep the money producing properties intact for further gains.

"&gt; Should we be competing our wages with people making $1 a day?

You don't have a choice.  They ARE the competition whether you like it or not.  Or you can close your borders to trade and not participate on the global market.   That won't work out well, fyi.
  
Why would they need to back up their claim with sources.  Is the fact that manufacturing (a union stronghold) has moved out of the country up for debate?  unique, undisputed claims are to be referenced, not well-know facts.  But if you want examples.

"I do not believe it is as simple as made out to be in your comment.

Where are Gamestop's fundamentals? What is the nature of its balance sheet? What is the nature of its debt? What is the nature of its current profitability? I think you will find that most of its fundamentals are negative.

It doesn't have the benefit of a digital business, no technology platforms that creates barriers of entry for competitors, no large subscriber base on which to build a digital game space or data to mine, no IP of its own. None of those aspects that the market uses to price tech growth stocks at a premium.

And saying that ""GS could issue a shitload of stock and pivot into whatever game spaces they please now"" seems to gravely misunderstand market dynamics.

To raise the many billions it will take to unseat players like Steam or Epic, will require substantive new issuance of stock.

GME is an incredibly volatile stock right now. What do you think will happen to the price when a large stock issuance is made? For most companies, the share price will drop, because it dilutes all the other shareholders. For GME, just based on the volatility of the counter, the share price will plunge. 

And again, it all goes back to fundamentals, which punters seem to have forgotten entirely in their fervant belief in the GME story.

"I didn't say Xinjiang was a country. In case you didn't know, there were plenty of parts that were technically ""China"", but they were largely autonomous regions that were governed by their own governments that only had very loose connections to the Imperial Chinese government.

When the PRC took control, they started to take more control by centralizing the government and take more control over all territories under their central government, causing many of these regions to lose their autonomy, as well as attempts to homogenize their culture which was seen as an erasure of the culture of those places.

This is the same issues that happen in Afghanistan, which is why so many of the Western powers have had problem building coalitions with the people over there.

Afghanistan isn't like many European countries or The U.S. Many regions and provinces have no national identity with ""Afghanistan"", and really have no working relationship with the central government.

"That chart randomly picks and chooses gun laws. What does it mean by some states having one or two laws? Most states have dozens of laws related to firearms. 

Like take for example Iowa. Iowa is given the Quartile 3 for showing strong gun control. Yet Iowa is a shall-issue state (until later this year when it becomes a complete constitutional carry), there are no storage laws, no weapon bans, no magazine bans, no registration, and they have castle doctrine laws. So where are they getting this strong gun control ranking? Seem like they just ranked states based on crime rather than anything else. 

If you look at violent crime with a firearm by county it tells a much clearer story. Counties with high amounts of regular violent with or without a firearm pretty much overlap with just firearm statistics. Most of this overlap also overlaps with impoverished areas.

I guess my comment is inaccurate now the more I think about it, but comparing the crime rate in a town of 1000 people in Alabama to the millions in Chicago and then lumping in all the surrounding info is hard to work with. Places like Chicago, Detroit, hell even like Houston are responsible for most of the violent crime, but also have most of the population. 

Its worth looking into more on my end I guess.

"I should rephrase that. It was truly scandalous when Britain was fighting Nazi Germany and after the war but Edward was sympathetic to fascists while king, before WW2 started. Before the war a Nazi supporter wasn't treated with the same levels of disdain, the Daily Mail for example very openly praised the Nazi regime's accomplishments in the early '30s. Edward was photographed in Berlin but it was only later that specifics came out regarding his interest in Nazism, the extent of it and what Hitler's plans might have been in regard to the British monarchy. It was known at the time but in hindsight it was much worse. In the late 1950s documents recovered by American troops in Germany (The Marburg Files) were published following more than a decade of suppression, enhancing theories of the Duke's sympathies for Nazi ideologies.

"&gt; Herd immunity and transmission rates are not completely separate concepts.

of course not, it is actually pretty direct inverse relationship. I mean it is more of a battle of semantic at this point. But your focus is on transmission rate which is affected by both herd immunity and mask. But I am focusing on the concept of herd immunity itself basically is percentage of immunized population. Masks and social distance is not going to increase percentage of immunized population. But will lower the level of herd immunity required to achieve the similar transmission rate. 

But the important point is the immunization process should not be stopped or slowed after the apparent lowered transmission rate from masks and the level of herd immunity.

"Addiction is NOT a choice.  This rhetoric is false and incredibly dangerous. 

Opinions like this is why so many addicts are dead.

Was that person *forced* to try drugs?  In many ways the answer is almost certainly yes.  

People get hooked on painkillers after experiencing a horrible accident.  They didn't choose to become dependent on pain medication, they had to use it to function. Which eventually develops dependency and then choice is out the window.

People who turn to drugs do so to *cope* with something in their life.  It's a tool to continue their survival or functioning ability. It's a desperate and temporary fix.

At first the drugs do help their life.  They're happier, or numb, or can move better or stay awake longer.  So many use drugs to self medicate mental health issues away. 

No one who is happy with life, and functioning properly and painlessly heads out to purposefully fuck up their life.  If a person does head out to purposefully fuck up their life, then there IS a reason why.  Even if that person doesn't understand what that reason is.

That doesn't mean that addicts shouldn't be held responsible for their crimes committed due to their addiction. They should have to repay that debt to society, but that shouldn't be the focus.

"I'm guessing a lot of people read articles like this about why the US military can't legally force service members to get vaccinated, even though they're able to mandate other vaccines.

Although it's unclear to me that whatever law allows members of the military to decline the vaccine while it's under EUA, applies outside of the military.  I'd have to dig further.

[The Military Can’t Get Troops to Take the Covid Vaccine](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/military-covid-vaccine/)
&gt; About one-third of military service members are refusing to take the coronavirus vaccine. In some units, refusal rates exceed half of all members. At a time when the virus remains as dangerous as ever, that’s bananas. Yet the military says troops who decline the vaccine will face no repercussions or changes to their assigned duties, meaning even uninoculated troops will remain deployable around the country and the world. What the hell?
&gt;
&gt;The deal is, federal law prohibits the mandatory application of medicines within the military that are not fully licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration. The three coronavirus vaccines currently available in the United States—the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and, as of Saturday, the Johnson &amp; Johnson versions—are approved on “emergency use authorizations,” meaning the drugs are technically still experimental. 
&gt;
&gt;There’s good reason for this law. The government and military have nasty histories of experimenting on people, including service members, without their knowledge or consent. And in fact, the law has been put to the test.",1617989973.0,gtyd4va,t1_gtxsofu,/r/news/comments/mngdhr/us_colleges_will_require_students_to_be/gtyd4va/,1.0,1618004373.0,"lot, people, articles, t1_gtxsofu, military, service, members, vaccines, law, vaccine, Troops, article, society, gt, third, coronavirus, units, refusal, rates, half, time, virus, bananas, troops, repercussions, changes, duties, country, world, hell, deal, application, medicines, amp, versions, emergency, use, authorizations, drugs, reason, government, histories, knowledge, consent, fact, test",0.30583333333333335,-0.03958333333333333,0.0

"Addiction is caused by lack of social bonds. If you don't have good relationships with people around you you will seek to get the positive rush of emotions that comes with it from somewhere else.

Ours also is not the golden age of enlightenment and being born in the past is often not an excuse for being evil.

"It's been a while since I worked a blue collar job, but my experiences with unions always made them more of a nuisance.

In college I worked part time at a grocery store for just above minimum wage and was required to pay union dues (such that after the dues I was at exactly minimum wage).  I didn't get any benefits like 401k, paid vacation, or health insurance.  So basically I was just a conduit for the union to get more money.

In my first ""real job"", I wasn't in the union but a lot of the building staff was, which put weird restrictions on the non-union employees.  If you moved from one cubicle to another, you had to box up everything on your desk, then have a union guy come and move the box to your new desk.

"&gt; no, because there are a lot of deductions that can be made to lower your burden that those at the lower end cannot make use of.

I’m aware of those deductions and even accounting for them, the US still has a more progressive tax system than most of the remainder of the OECD. The fact is that they tax their middle class way more than we do.

&gt; The overall tax structure has gotten a lot more regressive in the past 40 years.

Yes. And that’s happened everywhere. No country nowadays has the extreme top-heaviness of 70s American taxes. They’re artifacts of a bygone era.

This is absurd and you know it.  Your chance of getting more pay as 1 person bargaining vs a collective bargaining is next to nill.

like with minorities it's easy.   off the top of my head.   higher rates of incarceration,  unfair sentencing outcomes.  more frequent contact with police, this often results in higher rates of violence/injury at the hands of police.  or by proxy  higher rates of contact with the criminal justice system... laws implemented that unfairly target by proxy of over policing, minority groups.   this having levels of social and economic impact.     historical and even present day discrimination in housing lending,  access to homes,  home valuations.  historically.   discrimination in all those fronts,  as well as gov programs that specifically targeted them,  social stigma which viewed racial areas as less desirable... siphoning equity from minorities.   

medical diagnostics and treatments that lead to negative outcomes for minorities based on racism and racial disparity in training/consideration.  

employment discrimination,  from representation in higher lvl management positions,  historical and institutional pay disparity.  hell... name and visual discrimination from a hiring perspective.

Because you think you don’t need something until you do. Don’t go thinking your corporate overlords won’t toss you to the street the second it’s profitable to them. 

The idea that unions are “unnecessary” is based on the antiquated idea that if you’re loyal to your employer, they’ll be loyal to you. But unless you work for a small business of people who are all *actually* close to one another, they will show you absolutely *no* loyalty when it comes to profit. And good luck fighting a company with a legitimate *team* of lawyers. 

America has spent decades cultivating an image that its the regulations and the workers protections that are destroying businesses, that’s keeping the average Joe from becoming a millionaire. This has been pushed into the population since before most of us here were even born. And what do we in the US have to show for it? Our education rates are falling, our quality of life and life expectancy is falling, wages aren’t keeping up with inflation, the middle class is failing, people are more and more having work multiple jobs or stick with jobs that are emotionally and/or physically damaging because it’s the only way they can get healthcare for their family, some of the worst worker’s benefits in the western world, etc. 

Yet every year it’s the same thing. A bunch of 1%era spend more money in a year than we will ever see in a lifetime on lobbying and propaganda to try to convince us all that if we just deregulate *this next thing*, then this time they *swear* the middle class will thrive. But they never do.

"&gt; This doesn’t apply to warehouse workers for Amazon, but one frequent way they result in lower wages is for high performers. Union workers generally all get equal pay. But non-unionized workers who are higher skilled can frequently negotiate higher wages for themselves or more sales commissions. Again, just one example, and this doesn’t necessarily apply to Amazon warehouse workers. But if you think you’re at the top of a skilled field, it can often be dumb to unionize.

that happens when there is a discrepancy in renting vs owning.

* There is no legal precedent for an organization requiring people to receive a vaccine under EUA (as no vaccine has ever before been under EUA)

"DMX was literally a daily part of my life from ages 16-20. My high school football team would bark to get hyped and 20 years later, when guys run into each other, they still do it.

&amp;#x200B;

The prince was born into royalty, and died a royal after living nearly 100 years of privilege on this planet while having essentially no impact on my life other than a funny story once when the queen got stuck on a boat in my hometown. 

There's also a lot to be said about how useless the royal family is in general too. As a Canadian, even being part of the commonwealth the royal family means nothing to me.

"Correction: the bigger engines don't cause problems for the plane's design. If there was aerodynamic problems with the design itself, the plane isn't allowed to be certified by EASA, FAA according to their rules in the first place. The 737 max would be perfectly fine without mcas but would require a different certification from 737 ng. And since the only reason Boeing re engined the 737 was because American Airlines wanted a more efficient 737 ng, they couldn't afford to make the max have a different certification. Boeing didn't add any extra sensors on the 737 max from 737 ng nor is there a new control system. There's only an extra software called mcas. Both of these models have 2 sensors. 
The major problem with the original 737 max was that it relied on data from only 1 aoa sensor instead of the two it had and that the mcas was given too much power. But now the max relies on 2 sensors and the pilots can easily override mcas. Plus, the mcas will only activate once per flight if the aoa sensors indicate the plane is about to stall instead of the maybe dozens of times it did on the lion air and ethiopian airlines crashes after the single aoa sensor sent a false data that the plane was near stall.",1617987486.0,gty7f2e,t1_gty4cmj,/r/news/comments/mng99t/boeings_737_max_has_new_problem_that_will_ground/gty7f2e/,1.0,1618001886.0,"Correction, engines, problems, plane, design, t1_gty4cmj, rules, place, max, mcas, certification, reason, sensors, control, system, software, models, problem, data, aoa, sensor, power, pilots, flight, dozens, times, lion, air, airlines, stall",0.5326427540713254,0.09535405071119356,0.0

"Perhaps it was slightly implied, but I don't think that he flat out said that he's immune to criticism, more just an appeal to be realistic with our criticism. Someone born 100 years ago being a racist, while still terrible, takes a lot more willpower and rarity of character to make the adjustment to change their racist values. 

The statistics that we would most likely be racist as well is just for perspective to be aware of what we're criticizing and why. It's much less useful to criticize someone for not being a paragon of progressive thought in their time just because we have come a long way in terms of a moral baseline.

CDC hasn't informed hospitals around the county what to look for or how to protect staff. Man infects 2 nurses who treated him because they lacked the full body PPE. One nurse decides to go on an airline flight even though she feels unwell. In short, over 100 people had to be quarantined not to mention an entire apartment complex. Mass hysteria in the US.

"He is a political figure head...he’s not a politician...but he’s definitely a political figurehead... 

&gt;	And the people that are “eventually going to give up” were never going to give the policies a chance to begin with.

That’s just not true...there are plenty of examples of people doing the right thing in the beginning, and growing weary over time. 

&gt;	I’m not being arrogant, I’m simply pointing out stupid arguments that pretend to be rooted in some sort of logic are simply rationalizations masquerading as moderate discussion. This is a tool that has been used for at least the last 100 years, quite effectively.

But you are...you’re saying “it’s ok to lie to me when it’s for the greater good, but I know that it’s a lie, because I’m smart enough to know better”. 

&gt;	The snippet you’re fixated on is so far out of any sort of context to make it clear that you aren’t engaging in any sort of logical discussion. So I defer to the last question I posed.

The snippet I’m fixated on is one example, with a relevant source for context. 

Here is another snippet if it makes you feel better. 

&gt;	As Fauci told the Washington Post  here , at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, masks were not recommended for the general public, as authorities were trying to prevent a mask shortage for health workers and the extent of asymptomatic spread was unknown. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN26T2TR

All that needed to be said was “we are facing a shortage of masks right now. We urge you to use a mask or respirator if you have one, or some other face covering if you don’t until we can increase the supply of masks to medical personnel”. By that point the mask shortage was already such that there weren’t many on store shelves anyway, anc the shortages were at the supply end. Think of how many lives could have been saved in the beginning...just by flip flopping on the issue, it gave fuel to the anti-mask idiots..

"While I wouldn’t call the eastern supply lines easy by any stretch (not that they weren’t viciously mismanaged by Nazi bureaucracy), I definitely agree that even in the deepest, darkest Wehraboo dreams they know invading America would be a nigh insurmountable challenge without some sort of extreme, ahistorical serendipity where all of the U.S. carriers were obliterated at Pearl Harbor (somehow) or in their first contact with the Japanese.

The Germans couldn’t even invade Britain, and I don’t say that as a slight towards the IMMENSE efforts of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force to prevent a German incursion mind you. But the distance isn’t colossal.

As for anyone who’s made it this far into the thread in hope of finding some inklings of Prince Philip’s racist tendencies, I’ll link an article below with some of his more racy quotes. There are more you can find with a quick Google search; this one was selected because it wasn’t an obituary or recent article that might have tried to perhaps obscure what he may have said.

I think that, at the end of the day, people are different shades of grey. Prince Philip has been in the public eye for the last 70 years and I think that, in some ways, his presence is a comfort of its own. Like the Queen, he’s just been this enduring figure. Much like Ian Smith, who is quite possibly a FAR more polarizing figure than Prince Philip, I admire his HARDCORE determination when fighting in WWII and the absolutely insane shit he did. It’s movie quality stuff, and I’m not just saying that. However, the entire Rhodesian affair was...so rough, and I don’t want to start a flame war in the damn comments over that. I respect the fact that Prince Philip fought the Nazis, but I also recognize he was an intense racist.

"&gt;Why do Latino people outperform black people in cities black people run?

When people talk about ""systemic racism,"" this is what they mean. Years of institutional discrimination has created a state of affairs where Black folks as a demographic are considerably behind the 8-ball. The systems and forces in place that reinforce the current state of affairs are going to continue to operate regardless of who is in charge. 

Many black people experience generational poverty, for example. One of the pernicious elements of being in poverty is that it destroys any sense of the time value of money, which is an essential part of being an effective entrepreneur. You can't think about investing your time and money in a business if you never have any money to save. The stress and cognitive load associated with being in poverty also makes clear and effective problem-solving very difficult.

If her counselor sees that she needs to be on meds, or receive further therapy, they will see to it. 

The jail time is to let her cool her heels and think about what she did and why it was wrong to do so. 

As I said elsewhere, many county jails allow inmates to serve these short sentences on weekends and if she doesn't mess it up, she probably serves 20-25 days so figure 2 -3 months of weekends.

"Those of us who have sadly suffered a death in the family during the last year have had to endure brutal restrictions preventing all but the briefest moment of contact in a loved one’s final hours, their complete isolation while at the height of their sickness, and the final insult of max 30 people attending a funeral with an outdoor only ceremony and an urgent scramble to shove the coffin in the ground right at the start of proceedings.

I’m not naive enough to expect the same rules to apply to the Duke / Prince / whatever he called himself and their family but if the Royal Family are empathetic with their subjects in any way at all then they will avoid flaunting the regulations openly and in doing so insulting those that have suffered the greatest loss in the last year.

Equally, the BBC have just reported on Radio 4 that crowds gathering outside Buckingham Palace are being kindly asked by the police to observe covid guidelines... Not treated with zero tolerance and dispersed rapidly and with force as is SOP when they’re handling peaceful protest.

The hypocrisy on display even at this early stage is troubling imho.

I mourn the loss of any human being and absolutely hope he passed with minimal pain or suffering and I celebrate anyone reaching such a ripe old age! I sure hope he enjoyed his later years to their fullest.

However, the amount of plebs offering up their verbal diarrhoea for the BBC’s effortless vox pops that are claiming how radically this man touched their lives and made such a vast difference... I lose all hope.

When people mourn the loss of their oppressors you see how completely and totally the elites have won. I won’t celebrate a mans life who’s ‘service’ and ‘philanthropy’ was afforded him via the sweat of those who live with the foot of the elite on their neck.

"It sure doesn't sound like you do research because those things took a matter of two seconds to find. And no, I won't shut up about it because it's clear you are a partisan hack. If you don't like being called that, then maybe actually do some research. 

Also, the DPA is not just funding and no research would actually say it was just funding, so again, I don't think you actually research anything. Actually look up what that act does and what happened when Biden invoked that act for Pfizer. So that makes your entire second paragraph BS and not worth reading.

If mass vaccinations was a bare minimum, then why didn't your lord Trump do that?

Yes, Trump (poorly) dealt with the pandemic, but, no, Biden is not just taking a victory lap. That again just shows you're a partisan hack that doesn't actually care about fairness. Trump gets plenty of credit if you actually do your research. His plan laid a solid framework, but there were also tons of issues with his plan. That's why they were behind what he projected when he left office. Mentioning that isn't taking credit away from Trump. It's actually being fair.

Also, from your profile, you're like 14, so I'm not going to waste any more time arguing with a child that doesn't actually understand how the world, government, or politics work.

So when we left site the company was placing somebody in charge of some very dangerous equipment that had a steep learning curve. I was honestly concerned he might hurt himself or worse, somebody else. But it was out of my hands.

I said it's probable that Nigerian Americans will have longer lifespans than the average white American... because they're, on average, wealthier and more educated which correlates with a longer lifespan.

It was an expansion on my explanation on why Asian Americans tend to have longer lifespans, which is that they are generally the children of educated, wealthy people and are thus in turn likelier to be educated and wealthy themselves.

.... literally nobody ever anywhere in the article or this thread has asserted otherwise.

"This was after he abdicated. Upon further reading, it seems there is no evidence (that we know of) that Edward knew of or agreed to the Nazi plot to reinstate him as king. Nazi documents state that they planned to invade Britain and overthrow the Crown. Rather than abolish the monarchy, they wanted to place Edward VIII, the former king and Nazi sympathizer, as king. 

They attempted to manipulate Edward VIII into going along with this plan, by feeding him false information that his brother, King George had tried to assassinate him.

We do know that he was in regular communication with Nazi handlers, but we have no idea the degree to which they were successful in their conversations with him. We do know that the Germans gave up on their plan calling him ""too English in mindset."" 

It's unclear whether they ever told Edward the plan. It's possible that they did, but that he had no interest in their plans.

"I know i won’t convince you to change your opinion on income redistribution on Reddit, but as a fellow human being who also spends time on Reddit id ask you to give it some consideration. Income redistribution is absolutely necessary in capitalism, without it, the wealth does move upwards. Now, as we move out of a era of industrialization, we have are dealing with a system that causes even more wealth to be concentrated at the top. On top of that, the welfare programs we do have are pitiful compared to the rest of the developed world. There is enough wealth in the country for every person to have their basic needs met, regardless of if they contribute to the economy or not (because if they are given those essentials, they will contribute, meaning they won’t just sit on a basic income, they have to spend it). 

I recommend looking into it, because there are a lot of talking points used that aren’t actually true. I recommend listening to Rising with Krystal and Saagar. Best political info source I’ve ever seen and incredibly eye opening.

"In the late 60's Prince Philip used to occasionally go out at night in an armoured black cab that - at the time - was essentially invisible among the traffic of London. 

I know this because my father was a Grenadier guard at what among the guards of Chelsea barracks was affectionately called 'Buck House.' 

One evening my father's team would have shot and killed the Queen's consort as at 2am one morning he drove said cab at the gates of Buckingham Palace flat out. They didn't recognise the vehicle and assumed the driver was a terrorist.

They were lined up and just as hemy dad was about to give the order to 'open fire' and 'Swiss cheese' the cab a call from 'senior management' told them to open the gates and let the cab pass - which they did.

My father informed me that when Prince Philip pulled up and disembarked the vehicle he was immaculately dressed but was 'somewhat the worse for wear' and wished the guards a pleasant morning as he tried to 'sneak in.'

"&gt;Collective bargaining does not mean all 5000 employes get in a room and argue about what they want. It can happen rather quickly and their negotiations for things like improved wages need not take months and months like you imply.

From what I understand, they have ten days to start negotiations, then about 90 to complete them. 

&gt;Median tenure at Amazon is about a year, thats plenty of time for an employee to see clear benefits from unionization.

This is way off (from my information) but they don't publish it for obvious reasons. It's much closer to 6 months.

There are workers that are there for many years, and there are workers that are there for only a few weeks/months.

"Will power absolutely does play a role.

Unless the body is too overwhelmed or broken to continue functioning, your mind has a huge say so.

I think that raises so many questions.  I think our minds are very much a part of any ailments we have.  Not like we are personally responsible for being sick/in pain/mental illness.  But more like our mental state reacting to its environment has major influence on the body.

My husband's mom was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer when he was 5 years old.  He had two siblings, and the year prior his dad suffered a mental break down that he would never recover from.

She was given 3 months to live, it was so advanced. 

His dad became completely unstable.  Couldn't keep a job, couldn't help with the kids, and was completely irresponsible with money.  If she died and left the kids to him they would either end up homeless or in a group home.

She fought so hard.  She worked 3 jobs during chemo and raised those kids entirely on her own.  She flat lined during surgery, and the doctor actually came out and told them to prepare for bad news.

"I do research, shut up with the partisan hack stuff when all our media is partisan yet still claims it’s objective.

The DPA was pretty much just funding. I personally don’t think it was all too necessary considering the vaccination rates were fine, and while sped up vaccination is always nice, it costs a lot of money so you have to think about whether it’s worth it. The economy isn’t doing too great, and there’s going to be a spike in tax rates with the government spending so much. It’s my personal opinion that it wasn’t needed enough for the effect it had financially.

As for the mass vaccination; yeah that’s good. It’s a pretty bare minimum expectation that the president would do that.


Trump had to deal with the mass of the pandemic, and Biden is just taking a victory lap.

"You can condemn both? I think the main difference is that dictators are hard to remove, usually only through radical revolution and the people don’t have many choices. The fact that the British continue to support and pay for the lavish lifestyles of the British royal family doesn’t make sense. I already posted some stats above but they bear repeating here: in 2018-2019, the British royal family received 67 million British pounds, which was an increase of 20 million pounds from the previous financial year. That’s from a report from the Sovereign Grant. 

The concept of royalty is outdated.

"Yeah well...exhaustion is indeed the name of the game. In the rare occasion that I am home early about 2 hours or so I feel sucked dry of every conceivable emotion or motivation to do simple choirs. 

I have brought it up to my employer that I can’t take these hours for much longer. His defense is the old rethoric of : “I have always worked that much”

"Maybe it just makes sense to me because of my academic field. Specifically as everything in this thread is discussing moral hazard. Different application but same going logic. 

Admittedly, it’s not immediately obvious but the examples you gave show it. Although we may consider the ACA a moral hazard situation, it is contingent upon each individual’s valuation and there’s many questions about nonobserved behaviors. So someone that does not care and thinks they can maintain their lifestyle by repeated medical treatment would be considered such a case. But in another holding, the issue with ‘preexisting condition’ is that things like Type 1 diabetes. It isn’t like people ask for such a thing.

Personally, and professionally, I would not regard ACA to be a good example of moral hazard as a model to teach with, but for very different reasons (and I’m not saying there are not instances of moral hazard in practice). Personally, as the arguments often used assumes that congenital conditions are a moral hazard, yet, people don’t ask to be born with Type 1 diabetes. Yet, in such a condition, is it really moral hazard? (Not saying if it is or isn’t, just pointing out why it’s not that great of an example.)

But professionally, there’s so many ways to turn the ACA models up, down, left, and right and one can come to any number of differing conclusions already posited by various individuals, even I find it nauseating. I think it’s a bit ridiculous that people use a situation with so many variables to explain moral hazard, especially when on a quantitative basis. It also doesn’t help that a lot of explanations utterly oversimplify and misrepresent models used. And even all else considered, it’s just that the models and data used in fire and flood insurance have good, consistent information over a long period of time.

Definitely not a invalid point and situation to discuss moral hazard. Just not the one I would use when explaining it societally.",1617983758.0,gtxyubb,t1_gtxm43n,/r/news/comments/mn3iqk/california_to_pour_536_million_into_fire/gtxyubb/,1.0,1617998158.0,"sense, field, thread, hazard, application, logic, examples, t1_gtxm43n, situation, valuation, questions, behaviors, lifestyle, treatment, case, holding, issue, condition, things, Type, diabetes, people, thing, example, model, reasons, instances, practice, arguments, assumes, conditions, ways, models, number, conclusions, individuals, bit, variables, basis, lot, explanations, data, fire, flood, insurance, information, period, time, point, one",0.41614367114367123,0.09735449735449735,0.0

"I wouldn’t, the WuFlu is terrifying to me, but on Reddit I heard if I strap a napkin to my face from the door to my table at the restaurant I’m immune from viral attack, so I feel safe now.  

But it does interest me.  I’m 43, not obese, not diabetic; my chance of death from COVID is statistically less than 1/100th of 1%.  

When I saw stories in China of people dying on the street and the CCP boarding people into their homes and building enormous field hospitals I told everyone this was going to be huge.  Everyone called me a qtard conspiracy theorist. COVID was the flu. 

So I was the guy getting n95s (which DO help) when Fauci was telling us they don’t (lying so they could get them first not caring if the rest of us die).  Everyone called me a qtard conspiracy theorist.  Fauci wouldn’t lie. 

Then we learned this wasn’t the - drop dead in 24 hours at any age - disease we were told, so I decided I didn’t need the n95s and got in my car to Uber/Lyft when the paramedics were literally turning away respiratory rides to the ER. Everyone now decided I was a Trumptard science denier. I was dead for sure. 

Then I started looking ahead and predicting what would happen.  Mandatory masks.  Health passports.  Election fraud from votes never verified.  I was called a qtard conspiracy theorist again.  

Now I’m telling you this.  

The 1% are getting absurdly wealthy and powerful right now and they are punch drunk on it.  These little tyrants running our various levels of government also see all sorts of nefarious things they can do now that they couldn’t accomplish before.

That's a risk vs reward calculation the individual has to make. It's not always the best move to fight even when morally it's the right move - You can pay real costs. The world is not a fairytale.

Go up to the cartel when they're carjacking someone and put your foot down to fight back. You will die.

"&gt;	I mean... there’s also the active and overt dismantling of black communities that various American agencies engaged in. It’s a multitude of factors. But it’s not like black folks can’t figure it out; it’s just that the various footholds gained throughout the 1900’s were actively dismantled.

I think that’s true and untrue. We tend to think of things like the firebombing of black Wall St in Tulsa as the norm and not the exception. But today cities like Detroit, Baltimore and others are run entirely by black communities and you still see the highest rates of business ownership or access to food in Latino communities within these areas. Mexicantown in Detroit has 4 Mexican supermarkets in one tiny neighborhood of the city. 

The rest of the city is not so lucky and is filled with relative food deserts. Did America decide to let the Latinos build up over the blacks?

"&gt;Ok, and genuinely trans people are strong advocates for not having forced them through the wrong permanent changes
&gt;
&gt;Why do their experiences not matter for you?

I have read this comment several times and either I don't know what you're saying or you don't know what I'm saying...


""Genuinely trans people are strong advocates for not being forced through the wrong permanent changes?""


Their experiences *do* matter to me.  That's exactly what I'm saying.  I'm advocating that we don't force children into *any* permanent changes, wrong or correct.

I'm advocating that we let the kids grow up, mature, deal with their unique feelings and situation....provide as much support as we possibly can.  Then let them make an informed decision when they are legally allowed to make their own decisions.


I don't want parents making these sorts of life altering decisions for children.  To me it's no different than gay conversion therapy.  I am against that for minors also.  What I'm saying is....let kids figure themselves out and support them through the process.  If they want reassignment surgery or hormone treatments when they are adults, then I am fully in support of that.


If I take my child and give them puberty blockers and hormone treatments, you are going to screw with their entire biology.  They will not think or feel normally.  I will be *directly* controlling a *major* portion of their identity.  That's not a decision I should be able to make for my kids.  And kids aren't old enough to make informed decisions either.  So to me, the most logical solution is to let them make their own decisions when they are old enough to do so.

"I'm not bothered by Russia conducting targeted espionage, especially within ""the rules,"" because it's what nations do to protect themselves. Untold numbers of conflicts and even wars have been headed off by good intelligence over the centuries. There was a big brouhaha over the NSA tapping Angela Merkel's phone, but the reality is that all the NATO nations spy on each other, and especially on the US, because knowing what your allies are going to do is almost as important as knowing what your enemies are going to do.

On the other hand, I was worried by the potential effects. I have no special knowledge about what software is deployed where, but I do know that commodity software is present in sensitive networks. Disclosure of any sensitive information is important, and there is supplemental information that can come from the environment about what other software is in use, how it's configured, etc. Security policies and compliance with and effectiveness of those policies can also be measured and used to plan future attacks.

I am both bothered and worried (and angry, frankly) about China's approach. I don't blame them for conducting espionage in general; as I said before, it's what nations do to protect themselves. It's *how* they do it. If they had used the Exchange attack for targeted espionage against, say, defense contractors, it's bad for the US but it's within ""the rules."" I would have been worried about the effects against US national security. If the attack had quietly gone away with the patch, it would have mostly glided under the radar. But that's not what they did. They unleashed automated systems to download everything they could from every source they had identified, from government to contractors to small companies who barely had the expertise to set up an Exchange server, let alone configure it correctly (not that a correct configuration would have helped here). Companies that had no relevance to Chinese intelligence interests *at all* were hit just because they could. That's not how the game is played. Lashing out because your method is about to go bad invites response.

The rules developed over time to balance espionage needs and risk of events getting out of control. In general, most countries will avoid the latter even at the cost of the former. China's balance is different, and its leadership doesn't seem to care that the carefully tailored balance the rest of the world uses is one key part of what kept the US and USSR from nuking each other for 43 years.",1617982989.0,gtxx26j,t1_gtxuogr,/r/news/comments/mletl8/six_doctors_cnn_correspondents_detained_outside/gtxx26j/,1.0,1617997389.0,"t1_gtxuogr, espionage, rules, nations, numbers, conflicts, wars, intelligence, centuries, brouhaha, phone, reality, allies, enemies, hand, effects, knowledge, software, commodity, networks, Disclosure, information, environment, use, Security, policies, compliance, effectiveness, attacks, approach, attack, defense, contractors, security, patch, radar, systems, source, government, companies, expertise, server, configuration, Companies, relevance, interests, *, game, method, invites, response, time, needs, risk, events, control, countries, cost, balance, leadership, rest, world, part, years",0.5342086834733893,-0.011134453781512598,0.0

It all depends on what you believe. I know people that swear against unions and i know people that love unions. In my field of work union equals bad because you have the potential to make sooo much more money than your colleagues if you negotiate well. If you have a union everyone is on the same pay scale. They do save your job when needed and they are able to basically come together and change things that deemed unfair. Some people are ok with the working conditions at amazon and some are not. Some want more money some are just ok with making more than minimum wage.

Making sure people get the info they need should also help keep masses of morons from getting their shot, THEN going straight to packed bars to celebrate getting vaccinated.

It also gives a bit more time to do additional testing on vaccinated people that DO get sick, so that we can try to figure out which strains are more likely to generate breakthrough infections, and use that info to plan our next boosters or whatnot.

"If you come from a country where you have a prime minister / chancellor and, say, a president as head of state, then you just recycle the post endlessly every four years or so. For the people of the U.K. and commonwealth the royal family represent a constancy. We have had royalty for nearly a thousand years (with a bit of a blip) so they’ve always been there. When one goes,  a little bit of that constancy is eroded. Obviously not everyone feels the same way but that’s the gist if it. 

For a lot of older people who were around when the last war was on, the royal family mean a great deal. To denigrate them, to ignore what they feel, is immature and unnecessary.

It's such an issue in fact, that non-racist people have just stopped saying the word all together, as it's difficult to know why someone is dropping the n-word. Racist people will try and get away with saying it, which is why it's become such a loaded term. It's SO racist that you literally can not form the word on your voice without sharing an identity with people who say the word out of hate.

"&gt;  The public health agency added that racial minority groups “**experience higher rates of illness and death across a wide range of health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma and heart disease when compared to their White counterparts.**”

They already looked into the disparity over [diabetes](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/factors-contributing-higher-incidence-diabetes-black-americans) and found:

&gt; **biological risk factors accounted for most of the health disparity. These factors included a combination of body mass index, waist measurement, fasting glucose levels, lipids, blood pressure, and lung function.**

Also [hypertension](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.110.163196):

&gt; The long list of putative causes for this higher prevalence suggests that the real reasons are still unknown. **Biological differences in the mechanisms of blood pressure control or in the environment and habits of whites and blacks are among the potential causes. The higher prevalence of hypertension in blacks living in the United States instead of Africa demonstrates that environmental and behavioral characteristics are the more likely reasons for the higher prevalence in blacks living in the United States.**

I mean, if you factor in the above, is it not that much of a stretch to then understand [obesity](https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=25) as well?

&gt; In 2018, African Americans were 20 percent less likely to engage in active physical activity as compared to non-Hispanic whites.

Guess what else they looked into about [obesity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4830390/)?

&gt; **Race was not a significant predictor of obesity with depression relative to normal weight without depression status. However, racial differences were observed among the non-depressed. Non-depressed African Americans were more likely than non-depressed Whites or Caribbean Blacks to be obese.**

What about [asthma](https://www.ajmc.com/view/princeton-study-being-black-doesnt-cause-asthma-the-neighborhood-does)?

&gt; The trigger for asthma comes from things found in aging neighborhoods with older housing: **mold, rodent infestation, or air pollution. Being around people who smoke also causes asthma, even if a baby’s mother does not smoke. According to CDC, black men have much higher smoking rates (20%) than the overall population (15%), and the authors find that black women are more likely to smoke during pregnancy than white women.**

[Heart disease](https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/features/why-african-americans-greater-risk-heart-disease):

&gt; Four risk factors are the strongest predictors of heart failure: **high blood pressure (also called hypertension), chronic kidney disease, being overweight, and having low levels of HDL, the ""good"" cholesterol.** Three-fourths of African-Americans who develop heart failure have high blood pressure by age 40.

The problem here is that the CDC is now viewing disparities through the lens of critical race theory.  **Any** disparity is the result of racism.

"Three possibilities:

1) You're in an ultra competitive sector with incredibly limited talent. Your leverage is so much more powerful than the aggregate that there is no reason to bother.

2) You work in an industry with a heavy union concentration. Your employer has adjusted benefits to compensate because in effect union jobs are a substitute for what you do, and if pay is lower, all the best order-pickers/bricklayers/whatever can just swap.

Neither of those apply. The third does:

3) Your employer has massive leverage and has functionally infinite capital. They are one of the largest, most valuable, most powerful corporations on planet earth. They can close up shop and move operations 200 miles away, and they can do it 50 times if they have to.

Less stress on appearance. Lower bills from travel and eating out. A lot of these things were possibly if I wanted prior but it was way less feasible and I did not have the effort in that state.

"The Solar Winds attack affected a piece of software that runs on a Windows server. The software can monitor networked devices, not just network infrastructure, so it can keep an eye on routers, firewalls, switches, servers, desktops, kiosks, etc. In that sense, the SW attack had a broader attack surface. In addition, SW software often runs using privileged credentials, either on the local server or on the domain (this is a bad practice that my company regularly flags), and the credentials it uses to monitor systems are often privileged as well. These could allow access to vast swaths of information almost anywhere on the network.

What makes the SW attack more narrow is that the SW servers are rarely visible to the public Internet, nor should they be. They *should* be tucked away in a protected network with no access to the Internet. Microsoft patches should be installed through an internal patching server (either Windows Server Update Services \[WSUS\] or System Center Configuration Manager \[SCCM\]) and SW patches should happen through manual installations. The reality is that most companies allow their servers to talk to the Internet for patching.

(I have also read somewhere, but I can't find now, that the SW code had some internal checks that would see if it was in a desired target environment and would disable itself if it was not. This is, I've heard, considered good etiquette in the intelligence field. Spies have rules.)

Exchange was more narrow in that it affected only email. It's possible, even likely, that Chinese intelligence got hold of a bunch of credentials that were emailed to people (also a bad practice--deliver credentials through other means like voice or printed paper that can be destroyed). However, it potentially affected tens of thousands of organizations around the world. When they found out that the flaw would be patched in the then-next Patch Tuesday, they just unleashed the attack on any Exchange server they could find. That is considered bad etiquette, but from what I've come to understand from reading and podcasts, Chinese intelligence doesn't really care about the rules built up in the Cold War and to which most other countries generally adhere. There's a reason China has clients, not allies.",1617979464.0,gtxp3c1,t1_gtxhv2r,/r/news/comments/mletl8/six_doctors_cnn_correspondents_detained_outside/gtxp3c1/,1.0,1617993864.0,"t1_gtxhv2r, attack, piece, software, server, devices, network, infrastructure, eye, routers, firewalls, switches, servers, desktops, kiosks, sense, surface, addition, credentials, domain, practice, company, systems, access, swaths, information, Internet, patches, patching, \[WSUS\, \[SCCM\, installations, reality, companies, code, checks, target, environment, etiquette, intelligence, field, Spies, rules, email, hold, bunch, people, means, voice, paper, tens, thousands, organizations, world, flaw, reading, podcasts, countries, reason, clients, allies",0.48253757736516356,-0.006896551724137915,0.0

"That sounds like a super toxic environment and I'm glad you're out of it. But I also think you've internalised a load of nonsense from that environment into your own belief system. I don't know anyone who would say that what they earn or where they can travel (as a status symbol) is part of their happiness, short of needing to earn enough money to pay the bills. And the examples you gave of colleagues talking about reading a paper or being out on the mountains, they don't cost money. Everyone else isn't necessarily in this frenzied spending spree every weekend either. 

You're projecting the worst possible motivations onto your colleagues too. When you say your colleagues mention reading a research paper and you were doing art or binging TV as if this is going to be obvious to me as the reader that them reading the paper was the better thing to do - well, that's bollocks, isn't it. I bet in some of those colleagues' heads they're thinking, 'geez, WhiteDirty obviously thinks I'm such a dweeb for reading that paper, they didn't seem interested in it at all, wish I could be more chill like them'. When really, you're both fine, do what you want in your downtime. Or the self-confident of those colleagues just saw your disinterest and accepted it, because hey, they don't need your approval to enjoy their weekends, and vice versa. Maybe they talk about work with you not to flex but because it's something you both have in common and they're socially awkward? Or they genuinely find it interesting? Or maybe they're arseholes who are flexing, but who cares.

I guess I'm at a stage of my life where this is easier and I'm not depressed, but when people talk about taking extra shifts, I'll be open and frank that I'm not picking up the extra shift because the weather looks nice and I'm planning to go for a nice walk with my dog. Or I'll take the shift because I need a bit of money. If they had an incredible adventurous weekend, I'll ask about it and if they ask what I did, as often as not I ran the same route I usually run at the weekend and had something good for dinner one night. Sometimes, I'm the one who had an unusually great weekend. Either way, it's not a judgement on me or on my colleagues. We're all people with our own life stuff going on.

"You fundamentally misunderstand gun ownership. It isnt a privilege. It's a right. You can argue the damage it does outweighs the benefit. I don't care to argue that point however, because I feel it's irrelevant for 2 reasons/though processes; 1. Free speech can be very inconvenient. The gun issue would be settled if we didn't have free speech most likely. Should we eliminate that under the same logic? 2. Your scope for the value of gun ownership is too small. The US has been in a relatively prosperous economic situation since WW2, the situations self defense is required are fewer in that case. That doesn't speak to tomorrow, however.

You also miss the core argument of standing to a tyrannical government. And to precede your argument of ""muh strongest military"" you cant fucking glass Atlanta because the people are rebeling. You have to go door-to-door. That's a nasty situation. Some sandy lads in the ME have some experience there and have put good examples. Asymmetric warfare isn't so cut and dry.

Your qualifications for suitability are extremely subjective. I should be able to buy it because I want it; and no other reason if this truly a free society.

Idk why you'd be shocked by the registry. Through history they have been universally used to revoke gun ownership at a later date. Anyone who has read about gun restrictions in the past and atrocities that generally follow, they'd feel the same.

Non-licensed sales, such as private sellers? Selling something between two individuals is now a loophole? When it's already illegal if the person couldn't buy one from a licensed dealer? Is this what you meant, or am I misunderstanding?

Handguns should be universally available. Rifles are extremely dangerous to use for home defense due to overpenetration, rifles are nearly useless against melee combatants.

I'm saying rifle mags are already regulated. What constitutes high capacity in your mind?

Of course I don't want it. I'll gladly say that. It also won't work in my truly honest opinion. It's both.

Also, I want to say I really feel you are being intellectually honest, which I don't see much anymore. So thank you for that. I can deal with difference of opinion.

"First let me make a correction I meant censured not censored. The operation of a free and independent press is to inform the public and answer the 6 questions. They're famously listed by Kipling in his poem I keep six honest serving men. 

""I keep six honest serving-men
(They taught me all I knew);
Their names are What and Why and When
And How and Where and Who.""


They didn't answer those questions to the best of their ability. They didn't answer what, why, and who. I would grant them that unless it was an editorial it would be supposition to suggest why a 21-year-old black man would write graffiti directed against black people on a school campus. 

The rest of it seems appropriate covering the school's response to the incident.

“We know the acts of racism that have occurred this week are not about one particular person or one particular incident. We know that there is a significant history of racial pain and trauma on campus and we are taking action to repair our community,” college officials tweeted. 

Yet here again the article fails to answer those six questions. Why is this not about the particular individual and action taken that week? Does the school have a history of young black men writing racist graffiti on campus? Has that caused racial pain and trauma? What steps is the college taking to prevent young black men from riding racist graffiti in the future on campus?

This vaccine has gone through non of the typical protocols that vaccines typically go through, and I am in no hurry to go be a guinea pig. I’ll take my chances with the long term effects of COVID before I get a vaccine that didn’t go through the typical protocol of approval.

"Well there’s the glaringly obvious adverse reactions to the fact that the government has repeatedly reacted too late to COVID spikes, and acted too early when the cases went down.

Then there’s the ever old IndyRef2 and the tensions the mere presence of Scottish Parliament in Westminster. Add to that the creation of the Alba party which is a (to my knowledge anyway) right wing version of the SNP.

Then we have Brexit tensions. It was about a 52/48 split between leave and remain. 5 years of broken promises and “deals”. The biggest promise which was broken was there being no hard border in the Irish Sea. GFA/BA has been broken and that’s the biggest reason why there are riots and protests in NI currently.

Then we have the Police Bill. Which will make it illegal to peacefully protest - as anything deemed an “annoyance” can get you sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. This is a serious violation of human rights in the UK and the reason for the protests and riots in Newcastle, and Bristol (called Kill the Bill)

Add to that every day tensions from every day - that since the 1980s only South East England has had any development to it’s economy which is fuelling devolution/independence parties for the North, and the South West and you have one shit show called the UK

2. ""It looks like the kind of thing my daughter would bring back from her school art lessons,"" he muttered while being shown Ethiopian art in 1965.
3. ""I would like to go to Russia very much, although the bastards murdered half my family,"" at a very heated period of history in 1967.
4. ""What do you gargle with? Pebbles?"" he told singer Tom Jones at the 1969 Royal Variety Performance. Later he added: ""It's difficult to see how it’s possible to become immensely valuable by singing what are the most hideous songs.""
5. ""We don’t come here for our health. We can think of other ways of enjoying ourselves,"" he told journalists in Canada in 1976.
6. ""You are a woman, aren't you?"" he said to a Kenyan woman, who was presenting him with a small gift in 1984.
7. ""If you stay here much longer you will all be slitty-eyed,"" the Prince told British exchange students who lived in Xian in 1986. When asked on his opinion of Beijing, he replied: ""Ghastly.""
8. ""If it has four legs and it is not a chair, if it has two wings and flies but is not an aeroplane, and if it swims and it is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it."" Again with the Chinese insults, when he addressed a World Wildlife Fund meeting in 1986.
9. ""I don't think a prostitute is more moral than a wife, but they are doing the same thing,"" when dismissing claims those who slaughter for meat have greater moral authority than those who partake in blood sports in 1988.
10. ""Oh no, I might catch some ghastly disease,"" when asked if he wanted to pet a koala in Australia back in 1992.
11. ""You can't have been here that long — you haven't got a pot belly,"" he told a British tourist during a visit to Budapest in 1993.

12. ""Aren't most of you descended from pirates?,"" he enquired to an islander while in the Cayman Islands in 1994.

13. ""How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?"" he asked a Scottish driving instructor in 1995.

14. ""It was part of the fortunes of war. We didn't have counsellors rushing around every time somebody let off a gun, asking 'Are you all right — are you sure you don't have a ghastly problem?' You just got on with it!"" when asked about stress counselling for soldiers in 1995.

15. ""You managed not to get eaten then?"" the Prince asked a British student who had been trekking in Papua New Guinea, in 1998.

"My hreat grandpa lived to be 98. He outlived 3 wives. He lived up north in Ontario (Canada) in a housnhe built by a lake, fished, gardened, rarely went into the city, was pretty self sufficient. There were lake snakes in that fucking lake, we hated swimming in it. He was pretty deaf, but ""hearing aids are for old people!!!"" so we yelled a lot.

2 weeks before his death he moved to hospice in southern Ontario, where the rest of the family lives. He talked and talked, told stories, (really loudly), there were always visitors. He wanted strawberries one day, he had them, said they were the best things he's tasted, and died that night.

I was quite young, 13, my brother was 10, and his funeral was confusing because everyone was happy and joking and laughing. It was a celebration of life, he lived a damn good life.

You conveniently skipped over answering why wearing a mask (or, per this response, pants) is an ""unacceptable violation"" of your individual rights.

&gt; If you need a lawyer to tell you forcing people to be locked down in their homes is a violation of individual liberty then I don’t know what else to tell you.

So are you one of those libertarians who think ""Anything I feel like doing is a right"" or something? Because if so, that's not how the USA works. We have laws, and whether something is an infringement on rights is a legal matter.

&gt; Lol they admitted it was a lie to save masks for healthcare workers.

You'll need to be a bit more specific about what you're claiming. Are you saying ""they"" said masks don't work, or that there's not a benefit to people wearing them in public? I rather suspect you're putting a bit much stock in hyperbolic headlines.

"And that’s a fair point, but I still hold the opinion that there’s a tradeoff for each restriction posed,  it’s not something I want to flatly accept without a solid, demonstrable reason. In areas with extremely high rates of community spread, sure, some more aggressive local restrictions make sense. If we’re not going to be extremely strict as a whole nation and shut down borders, that’s the next best solution if you’re trying to focus on case count while minimizing negative impacts to society.

I’m still of the opinion that a lot of restrictions are absolute bullshit depending on the locality’s current case counts/status on community spread. I’ve seen it play out across dozens of cities in the US.

I understand the data now makes a decent case for triple-making and staying in my bedroom for the rest of time as the safest option. But at some point, we’ve gotta accept that there are diseases in the world, and this is one of them. I won’t be waiting for 90% vaccination rates, that’s for sure.

"My grandparents went into the hospital within days of each other. After my grandmother died, grandpa moved into a rest home just a couple of miles from my home. I spent more time with him than any time since I was 9, when I had spent the summer with them. 

My grandmother was the classic battleax when it came to him. She was constantly harping on him about this that and the other. I came to realize it was a vicious circle where he retreated into a kind of Walter Mitty existence to escape her harping which caused her even more anguish, and by extension, created more bitterness directed at him. 

So, it was no surprise he had a kind of spring in his step as he contemplated life without her. He told me he was going to look up the cute girl that had served him at a McDonald's some years prior.

"Elon Musk grew up using emeralds in place of cash to trade for shit he wanted.

"Granted, it’s a tough sell, but if GameStop was truly dead and buried - why would they hire on so many new execs from successful companies, report a better Q4 than expected, and plenty of cash in their coffers? There’s been releases of store redesigns and various future plans for the company, along with their already interesting shift towards selling computer parts with next-day (and in some instances same day) delivery?

I know outside of the meme stock subs it sounds insane, but the reality is that whether it’s a short term money maker or long term growth - there’s plenty of evidence that signals the stock is not overvalued at it’s current price. Obviously it’s not going to stabilize as a Berkshire Hathaway, but if the new management is successful it would revitalize the company and position it to compete into the digital future.

Cohen took a dog food company and turned it into a successful online pet supply company, and he’s brought on other execs from Amazon and chewy and elsewhere to turn GameStop around. If they can’t do it, I lose a little bit of money as does any investment opportunity - but if they succeed I set myself up a nice retirement fund.

See in order for a police state to exist, you need police.

Tanks, Drones, missiles, aircraft, these things are shock weapons. Line breakers. Capable of indiscriminate destruction.

You know what they can't do?

    Raid an apartment complex looking for weapons.
    Enforce Curfew
    Chase Bob into the sewers beneath the projects
    Chase Robert into the swamps
    Root insurgents out of a hospital
    Stop and frisk civilians on the street
    Interview potential suspects

For all of these things you need men. Boots on the ground. And they are very much vulnerable to small arms fire.

If you don't think guerilla fighters can stand up to the US military, well, how well are we doing in the middle east?

Do we have security, and victory? Or do we have an expensive and deadly quagmire that is a hotbed for extremists and recruitment?

Also if you think the American people are sick of the war there, imagine now it's at home. How many US hospitals can you bomb before the public turns against you? What is there left to rule over when you've blown up the bridges?

How long can you keep your own soldiers on your side when you tell them to bomb their neighbors, their, friends, their sons?

"Well you take a company like gm, last year they made 122 billion in revenue, they have 122,000 employees (55k of which are uaw, meaning the uaw is 45% of their labor force), and it's just math from there. Figuring the average employee works 2000 hrs a year, that brings the average hourly revenue generated by a union worker to nearly $500 (54.9 billion (which is 45% of their total revenue) divided by 55000 employees divided by 2000 hours a year).

Let's say that's not enough for ya, if you take the same 45% and applied it only to their profits, subtracting costs, you're still at $50+ per uaw worker hour worked in just profits.

Obviously this is not a perfect way to find an exact number, revenue comes from different places after all, but it gives a good starting point to show at least a basic picture of how much a company makes vs their workers (which are the ones shamed by the public for being greedy somehow).

"Judging from the union website, they only offer three main benefits. Safer working conditions, Just-cause termination (rather than at-will employment), and grievance procedures to challenge disciplinary measures.

They don't promise wage increases, or expanding benefits.

There are several problems here. First off, warehouses are regulated under OSHA, which means work conditions are already extensively regulated. You can find OSHA reports online and see whether OSHA puts fault on Amazon for workplace accidents or not. It is fairly rare for Amazon to be fined for workplace conditions. The union claims that Amazon warehouses are extremely hazardous, yet OSHA says the opposite. Workers die in warehouses, but workers also die in Wal-Marts. There isn't a huge disparity that says Amazon warehouses are extremely hazardous or more hazardous than other warehouses.

The other problem is pay has been going up for Amazon workers for the last few years, and not just for Amazon workers but also seasonal workers who are employed by staffing agencies. The union doesn't promise pay raises, so that benefits Amazon. There is also no talk of increasing benefits, which helps Amazon since it pays college tuition, paternity/maternity leave, healthcare, etc.

The only thing the union really offers is establishing a contract that will bind Amazon to legally fulfill those existing benefits. The union can define policies that workers support, include that into a contract, and then get a legal agreement with Amazon to fulfill that contract. So if the workers get a contract with two 30 minute breaks in their ten hours shifts, both Amazon and the Union are obligated to make sure those breaks are maintained. If either wants to change those break times, both Amazon and the Union have to come to a new agreement and sign a new contract.

These are very minor benefits when considering that most of the workers who have spoken out against Amazon are asking for a pay increase, which Amazon opposes, and which the Union refuses to commit to. The union touts the Department of Labor's data that says union workers make 27% more than non-union workers, but also refuses to commit to a pay raise for Amazon workers. Yet, this is exactly what Amazon workers are demanding. So there is no real reason for workers to support the union.",1617975460.0,gtxgjh5,t3_mn3xcn,/r/news/comments/mn3xcn/amazon_unionization_drive_losing_by_21_margin_in/gtxgjh5/,1.0,1617989860.0,"union, website, benefits, working, conditions, termination, will, employment, grievance, procedures, measures, wage, increases, problems, warehouses, t3_mn3xcn, work, reports, fault, accidents, opposite, Workers, workers, disparity, problem, pay, years, agencies, raises, talk, college, tuition, paternity, maternity, leave, healthcare, thing, contract, policies, agreement, minute, breaks, hours, shifts, break, times, increase, data, %, raise, reason",0.4341548821548822,0.18414646464646467,0.0

"Here's what the flight logs reveal:

Feb. 9, 2002 — Clinton hopped a flight from Miami to Westchester, New York, where he lives.

March 19, 2002 — Clinton was listed as flying from New York to London and then returning two days later.

May 22, 2002 — Clinton flew from Japan to Hong Kong. The next day he flew to Singapore (by way of Shenzhen, China), where he gave a speech. On May 25, he left for Brunei, by way of Bangkok.

July 13, 2002 — He attended a wedding in Morocco and then hopped a flight to New York, stopping in the Azores.

Sept. 21, 2002 — Clinton left for a nine-day trip to Africa with actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, visiting Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, Mozambique and South Africa. While there, he worked on HIV and AIDS prevention projects, democratization, and economic development. He finished the trip in England, where he addressed the Labour Party during its annual conference. In a 2002 profile of Epstein, Clinton is quoted as saying through a spokesman, “Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science. I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS.” According to the flight records, this was the longest trip Clinton took on Epstein’s plane, and it accounted for 11 of the 26 total flights.

Nov. 4, 2003 — About a year after the Africa trip, Clinton took what appears to be his last trip on Epstein’s plane. He flew from Brussels to Oslo, where he had a two-day visit with officials to work on his project to prevent HIV and AIDS in developing countries. He then flew to Hong Kong, by way of Siberia, and finished the trip in Beijing.",1617975153.0,gtxfx2a,t1_gtxf56b,/r/news/comments/mnf41a/prince_philip_has_died_aged_99_buckingham_palace/gtxfx2a/,1.0,1617989553.0,"flight, logs, t1_gtxf56b, days, day, way, speech, wedding, trip, actors, prevention, projects, democratization, development, conference, profile, spokesman, financier, philanthropist, sense, markets, knowledge, century, science, insights, generosity, citizen, service, records, plane, flights, year, visit, officials, project, countries",0.29202020202020207,0.09060606060606062,0.0

"I definitely don't disagree.  I do think that from my own personal experience, depression and social anxiety can sure make us feel like that.  I remember being seriously broke at my first job, student loan debt, far away from home, new city, 0 friends.  Then you go to work on Friday, and your boss is telling you about his epic weekend plans and I'm just thinking, geez it must be nice. I think people forget how difficult it is for young people to go work in an office with people much older than you.  You spend your entire teens and 20's in school preparing to do this job and then suddenly your surrounded by people that own cats and property and have family's a and go to their vacation homes or travel to Europe to see their kids, or kids, kids...   

And suddenly your not cool anymore and now your just a broke ass millennial with students loan debt that has to start grinding at this job 60+ hours a week because you work in a highly creative and competitive field and literally everybody your age in the office wants your job.  Then between the epic boss stories you have the backstabbing coworkers trying to collect dirt on you or the I'm 40 and just got a degree so let me passive aggressively harass this 25 year old so I can get a reaction out of them and get them fired.  

Some office jobs are literally like steping into a cage match person after person. My job required me to be talking to so many people in the office and outside the office. People constantly splaining to you. The same splaining over and over.  Depression can make this so difficult.  I became a social animal in those first few years and my confidence levels grew.  But the social aspect was always harder than the actual job itself.  I was laid off from this job about 6 months before covid.  For 6 months I relaxed and did a deep cleanse to rid my mind of that toxic environment and some of those people.

I then grabbed my new job in March of 2020 right as the pandemic was taking off.  I have never fully met my coworkers, i started working remotely from home on my second day.  I guess I only know computer people.  The people I work with today are great, and overall I'm loving remote work.  I just can't imagine going back.  What I realized is that I am the type of person who want to do my job, get out on Friday and be done.  I don't need to flex or constantly be talking to coworkers about my field.  Maybe I'm lazy idk.  But it does get exhausting when coworkers are trying to tell you about this research paper they read over the weekend and your like we'll I ate some pizza and binged watched better call Saul.  Or in my case I'm usually doing art or partaking in one of so many hobbies.  But we live in such a different time when people don't spend their weekends being creative they spend it spending money.  And it's almost like that in and of itself is what makes people depressed.  The very idea that we calculate our happiness on what we can spend.

"ah, but this isn't really eliminating the idea of prison completely.  note i mentioned also paying off the room and board while serving your sentence (i might not have made it clear in my first comment, but i would have it where a convict is put up in a facility while serving their sentence, not the dungeons we have now, something more like the minimalist apartments they use for prisons in wherever-it-is, europe).  the idea is that we're not *punishing* people with years of suffering, that benefits no one.  we're *enforcing* restitution to the victims of crime.

and you are absolutely correct, this does retain elements of ""traditional slavery"" and my point is that that is not necessarily a bad thing, as long as the work imposed benefits the victims of crime, and not a corrupt prison-industrial complex.  if you steal a car, it's not going to take your whole life to pay that back.

for individuals that need to be removed from society, for instance a murderer who is likely to kill again, the system of course would require some adjustment.  but, if your actions were to result in someone losing their life, no amount of work can ever pay to restore that person to life, so murder and manslaughter means you're in for a long haul anyway.

"&gt; In general, men tend to be more vulnerable to the widowhood effect. Men are affected more socially than women. Women tend to maintain social relationships and friendships outside of marriage, so when the wife dies first, men tend to lose out on these social relationships and support groups and they tend to isolate themselves. Women maintain their friendships and relationships and lean on them for support after their spouse dies.

"Granted, some of it is mental aspects weigh on you near that age as a reason people don't want to live that long, which is sometimes worse then the physical. 

By the time one of my grandma's was 94 she was in her words ""ready to die."" At 94 she had out lived her parents, her older brothers(they only made it to 88 and 91), her 3 stepsons that were just 10 to 18 years younger then her, her only husband(my grandpa) who was 17 years older then her and died at 99, 4 of her best friends from college, and many neighbors/friends(due to my grandparent's professional and volunteer work they would get 200 Xmas cards a year and by the time she died she was getting 10-20 from outside of family).

My grandparents on my Dad's side who are 93 and 90 felt kinda the same way when I had lunch with them a week before all the shutdowns last year. They were the last of each of their brothers and sisters. They have seen 4 or so nephews die. And they had already had a son pass away from cancer. So they weren’t that scared of Covid-19.

"I think it's simply because we're in an increasingly connected but socially disconnected culture.  Despite being told not to numerous times, people can't help but to compare themselves to others, and finding their lives are going no where while everyone else's are going somewhere can be frustrating.  To hear about someone's sex life, having a kid on the way, getting married or moving into a new home, etc every single day can push some people, depressed and convinced they will never have any of these experiences, over the edge.  

Being without these reminders makes their own lives seem a little more normal.

There's also the bitter side that some may find a catharsis in seeing these otherwise happy people miserable experiencing just a year of the same isolation and loneliness that has been their life.  And sadly, I'm still not sure there will be much awareness for the pain of isolation/loneliness when all the lockdowns are finally lifted.",1617973662.0,gtxcz4r,t1_gtwla66,/r/news/comments/mn3ywy/us_suicides_dropped_last_year_defying_pandemic/gtxcz4r/,1.0,1617988062.0,"culture, times, people, others, lives, sex, life, kid, way, home, day, experiences, edge, reminders, side, catharsis, year, isolation, loneliness, awareness, pain, lockdowns",0.5845541885015569,0.008461494645705165,0.0

"Ok look, i came off too aggressively in my reply and i apologize for that, regardless of whether or not you care about a random internet stranger apology. Fwiw i agree with what you were saying (i thought i suggested that in my reply but i could have been clearer about it). 

But i also know a lot of people who aren't lazy, just misinformed, because they genuinely don't know **how** to research- yea sounds silly to me, but critical thinking and library science aren't really covered very well in the school systems i grew up around (USA). You're right, articles often have an agenda that undermines whatever objective truth there is out there, but the point i'm trying to make is that if you let people loose on the internet to do ""research"" that's where most will end up. And if we're lucky, maybe they click on the article link to the study/research in question. But i think we all know that doesn't happen much, and if you read a study that you believe in and are confident in the information you provided, i really don't see how it's labor to locate a link or two from where you got your info. (yesss, it is information from your perspective, but understand that from the perspective of someone who doesn't know those things to be true yet, they are in fact ""claims"" until proven otherwise- literally, it's the definition of a claim in this sort of context). 

I get the feeling you don't really care about what the other perspective thinks here, and correct me if i'm wrong on that. But IF that's the case, then why put in the labor to comment on a post and provide information to others to educate them, but not provide the source for that info?

"Thank you for the articles. The first one doesn’t really address any particular data or details on actual racism. Most of the article relates to topics like people of color being disproportionately affected by COVID-19 or access to medical care and health insurance. However these can easily be explained with people of different ethnicities being affected disproportionately to certain diseases and also the argument completely disassociating Socio economic realities between different ethnic groups. So in short if black Americans have less income and wealth then they are going to have less access to quality care.
The first article, obviously from a biased source, only sites one study that’s worth examining, although it is retrospective in its nature. If the findings hold weight that would only equate to a 17% difference and white healthcare workers assessing the pain in black patients, which isn’t hugely disproportionate. 
The Harvard article, which is really just a personal blog it seems, just lists off a bunch of anecdotal experiences and extrapolates it into some sort of blame for systematic widespread racism across the country. The blog itself states with complete conviction that there is a racial disparity in healthcare in the United States without sourcing that claim.
It’s clear the evidence is weak that doctors, insurance providers, nurses, pharmacy technicians all across American landscape have racial bias against people of color. You can’t tie in the Socio economic realities that people of color are experiencing disproportionately to Asians and whites, which could be due to a myriad of things including personal choice, to the results of their health and just state the claim that the whole system is racist.",1617973421.0,gtxcinv,t1_gtx87js,/r/news/comments/mn1lo8/cdc_says_racism_is_a_serious_threat_to_public/gtxcinv/,1.0,1617987821.0,"articles, one, data, details, racism, article, topics, people, color, COVID-19, access, care, health, insurance, ethnicities, diseases, argument, t1_gtx87js, realities, groups, income, wealth, quality, source, study, nature, findings, weight, %, difference, healthcare, workers, pain, patients, blog, bunch, experiences, sort, blame, country, conviction, disparity, claim, evidence, doctors, providers, nurses, pharmacy, technicians, landscape, bias, whites, myriad, things, choice, results, system",0.38200280112044815,0.07787114845938378,0.0

"Who do you think gave it to the labs for checks, lol? His government did, because they want to simply wash their hands of any responsibility in case there are issues. 

If he wasn't a weak clown, they could've been vaccinating with it for weeks. It was approved by health minister already. But being the weak clown he is, they wanted to give it a resemblance of process expecting that the'll do some basics checks and everything will be fine... and even that failed.

So now he's going to kick around himself like the child he is.   
What you're saying is basically, we shouldn't trust experts, and instead full trust politicians who say ""it's ok"".

You know what this lovely ex-PM said when they asked him if he's going to vaccinate himself and his family with Sputnik?   
""I don't know""

At least Orban had the balls to take vaccines he imported.

Honestly I don't mind Sputnik at all, even if unapproved... Let those who want take it... at least I can get a properly approved and tested vaccine earlier.  
And if everything turns out great with Sputnik and it's eventually approved then everyone wins.

Yes

&gt;	As for lockdowns, I suspect there are a lot of armchair lawyers out there making these claims. If it was such an closed case, I rather doubt that they would have remained in effect in so many states.

If you need a lawyer to tell you forcing people to be locked down in their homes is a violation of individual liberty then I don’t know what else to tell you. 

&gt;	You mean initially, when the virus was not well understood? As scientists learn things, their conclusions and recommendations will change. That’s not dishonesty, it’s science.

Lol they admitted it was a lie to save masks for healthcare workers.

&gt;	I don’t recall hearing this. And regardless, we’re nowhere near every American being vaccinated. So, not too wrong, I guess?

"This is the commentary of a person that just doesn’t care.  Fuck you and your selective outrage.  

For one you didn’t read your source.  Pro Bono lawyers are the ones that located the children.  The same lawyers that the Biden administration barred from viewing the child detention facilities.

Two - you do not care about these children.  It’s why you’re crying about ambiguous issues like “fascism” as opposed to the fact that Obrador himself holds Biden’s mismanagement of this situation for the humanitarian crisis at the border.  Or the fact that Kamala Harris was put in charge of the crisis and refuses to even visit the border.

These images were *leaked* against the wishes of the Biden administration.

"There are only two instances of the husband of an English Queen became King.

Phillip II of Spain who was married to Mary 1 of England and was a monarch in his own right as the Spanish monarch, but his was conditional to being King as long as she was Queen, so co rulers, and William III who was the monarch of what is known today as the Netherlands as the Stadtholder.

Please educate yourself.  Deaths are going down across the board, and so far, it seems like the UK is doing well - down to roughly 100 deaths a day.  When is this mutation gonna kick into high gear? You seem to know all of the answers.

&gt;it's still not safe to get on a plane if you're not vaccinated at the very least

How do you know this?  Literally the CDC just relaxed its rules on cleaning because it was heavy handed and unnecessary.  Did you even read my links at all?  Or did you just glance at it and assume you knew better?

&gt; you're exactly the type of person that keeps this going on and on because you won't modify your entitled behavior even the slightest.

I actually wear my mask, and social distance?  Do I **HAVE** to get the vaccine for you to feel better?

So heres my question shitforbrains - If getting the vaccine doesnt prevent the illness (just death), and does not prevent the spread (right?), even if I get the vaccine, I can still spread it to others. Correct?

So if I dont get the vaccine, I can still spread it to others, I just *personally* have a chance to die from it affecting me worse...correct?

So besides my own personal health, what is at risk if I dont get the vaccine?  This isnt polio.  This isnt Measles, Mumps, Rubella.  This isnt Hep A/B/C.  If I get the vaccine, I can still transmit.  So why get the vaccine if I feel my health is in order.

Tell me, oh wise one, what actions am I doing that are causing this to keep going on?

And you're right, many will! Many will also misdiagnose you outright which can complicate actually being unhealthy due to weight. Which again can be the cause of why you are obese. Here's another article on the subject.

On the topic of your own quotes did I say that it was true for a majority of people or even that you shouldn't try and be healthy?

"They aren’t just descriptive, though — the words “revenge” and “porn” makes it a values statement — revenge ascribes a motivation to the person posting it, and porn ascribes value to the content. That is obviously not a controversial values statement, and it’s one that I would hope that the vast majority here agree with, but it is definitely not an objective, descriptive statement. “Sexual photographs” definitely fits the bill better in that regard.

That being said, emotionally loaded terms like “revenge porn” are very useful — it is a lot harder to detach yourself emotionally from it because it promotes an immediate visceral reaction of “I don’t like that”. George Carlin did a bit about how we did a disservice to our soldiers by changing the name for the term from “shell shock” to “post traumatic stress disorder”, because the latter is so dry and clinical that it’s a lot easier for people to gloss over it and sweep it under the rug, and I think he has a good point.

"My understanding is that suicide rates often have an inverse relationship with how safe and secure a population is generally. I read a story once of a researcher visiting a tribe of people living deep in the jungle in Africa, cut off from even modern african culture. He found, through studying their language and talking to them, that their culture had no concept of suicide.

The theory goes that among those who struggle to survive every day, the thought of ending it simply doesn’t occur, so focused are they on survival. It is only when all of your basic needs are taken care of and you are free to sit and contemplate such high-brow thoughts as,”Am I happy?” or, “Is life world living?” that ending ones own life even becomes a considered possibility.

When our basic security is all-but guarantied, multiple social safety nets in place should we lose our jobs, and even places to go in the worst case scenario where we become homeless, most people, even those living paycheck to paycheck, know that we’ll make it through somehow.

But then a pandemic hits, and suddenly people are having to face the fragility of our way of life in a way that we never have before. Our social security net is tested, and frays under pressure. People are out on the street, and for the first time since maybe 9/11, people truly feel vulnerable, like our entire way of life hangs in the balance.

They’re not considered alive because they don’t metabolize anything to create energy for in order to carry out non-spontaneous processes for themselves. They’re literally just molecules that “replicate” using the host’s cellular machinery. Mutations occur in their nucleic acids similar to those in living species. RNA viruses mutate pretty rapidly though because RNA mutations have no “proofreading” enzymes to repair their them. Ultimately the viruses which carry mutations that make them stable survive while the disadvantageous mutations become rapidly denatured in their environment.

She had been dead for two years at this point, so he basically said to himself, ""I'm not dealing with whatever that is"" and went back to sleep. Later that day, he remembered the call and saw he had a voicemail from his mothers number. He listened to it and... it was the rental company! Apparently they had coincidentally gotten that number when they opened up in the interim between cancelling service on her phone and the present. They were calling to let him know he had forgotten something in the car. 

He told me that story and we both couldn't help but laugh at how weird and coincidental it was.",1617971046.0,gtx89ez,t1_gtx5nfc,/r/news/comments/mnf41a/prince_philip_has_died_aged_99_buckingham_palace/gtx89ez/,1.0,1617985446.0,"story, scenario, dad, grandmother, number, cell, phone, day, mom, road, trip, nap, car, caller, d, mother, years, point, sleep, call, voicemail, mothers, company, interim, service, present",0.37,0.04500000000000002,0.0

"&gt;""Lastly, the company claims “over $1 billion of federal income tax expense.” But most of that is what accountants call a deferred tax liability, meaning Amazon has not yet paid it. Amazon reports a current federal income tax of just $162 million in 2019, meaning that is what Amazon paid in 2019. The company reports that it deferred $914 million of federal taxes to future years.""

So? Deferring is completely standard stuff, it's nothing nefarious or controversial. For FY2019, they *will* pay over $1B in fed income tax, just not right now. What difference does that make?

&gt;Amazon merely collected sales taxes from customers and sent those tax payments to state and local governments.

Yes, that is the nature of all corporate taxation: it gets passed on to customers. 

&gt;The people who are not ""clamoring to have them set up shop in their town over someone else's"" are the actual workers, customers, and smaller businesses. 

Great - I don't really care. That's a problem with their local government, not Amazon.

I didn't say that. I said they didn't need to lobby to get states to throw money at them to get them to come to town.

"Very well stated. I agree with every word. I would also lay some blame at the feet of the NCAA and universities. That's the point in the lives of NFL players where they have the most access to the best education in their lives. But the schools only encourage them to play ball, not get a quality well-rounded education. 

I went to U of Michigan, which is a world-class educational institution. But don't expect the football players that are drafted from Michigan to be any more well educated than a walk-on. And I think that shows that universities are simply exploiting these kids for money. The schools have the resources and staff to give every player finance, legal, and health education. They should also allow and encourage any player to return to finish their degree after their career is over. 

I blame the teams less because they compensate the players well enough to figure this out on their own, the players are all adults by the time they enter the league, and they aren't an educational institution.

"possible data is still out on it but so far the rate of transmission drops dramatically. The virus has to multiply before you can spread it. The vaccine cuts off that ability. It's a race of your body blocking the virus in time. So far it seems to act incredibly fast. 

My friends parents were in a house where everyone got Covid. Between three households it spread over a matter of a couple days hospitalizing 2 adults in their 40's. 

The elderly parents, both in their late 70's and vaccinated with Moderna, not only showed no symptoms and had no issues, they tested netagative for the virus all four times they were tested over 2 weeks. 

tl;dr this isn't like taking a ""nyquil cold and sinus"" pill where you alleviate the symptoms and makes you stronger or even like an anti-bacterial where the drugs kill off the virus and help your immunse system out. 

This goes to the core of how the virus works and takes the ability for it to reproduce out of the equation. If it can't latch on to the cells and insert it's code into your cell then it can't reproduce. Which means the chances of it spreading are way low.

"&gt;I like how you conveniently ignore straw purchases by Indiana residents.   
&gt;  
&gt;Your lengthy write up all depends on the flawed assumption that the end user of the gun in Chicago is the same person that purchases it at the gun shop. 

I didn't conveniently ignore straw purchases. I was working on the argument that if someone wants to commit a crime but can't buy a gun legally in Chicago, they go an hour away into Indiana and buy it legally. 

I'm sure some people are going into Indiana and getting guns through straw purchases. In those cases, both the person getting the gun and the person buying the gun for them are committing federal felonies. The clerks at gun stores are usually trained to identify straw purchases/purchasers, and can deny a sale at any time for any reason. If the clerk knows it's a straw purchase, they are also committing a federal felony. 2-3 people committing federal felonies do not constitute a legal gun transfer.

&gt; 21% of guns seized from crimes in Chicago originate in Indiana gun shops. 

And how they get there matters.   
Were they straw purchases? Multiple federal felonies involved.  
Were they stolen from Indiana residents? Multiple felonies involved.

So what the hell.  You keep saying you don't understand me, yet you're deeply offended, so I don't have any strong hopes here, but . . . 

I did not say the NAS was ""facebook university professors,"" and I think you know perfectly well I did not.  I said

*You are pushing an extreme, untested, unlikely mega-engineering quasi-solution that most experts -- actual experts, not Facebook University professors -- find unserious*

Then you said the report was published by the NAS.  Then you applied what I'd said about the geoengineering project and applied it, on your own, to the NAS.  The *report* is not dimming the sun.  You can't not know that.  If you can't read what I say, you're not really getting mad at *me*.

The NAS issued this report recommending $20 million a year for five years to create a process to *study* this geoengineering project, which is nothing like endorsing such a project or funding it.  The NOAA specifically said there are two good reasons to study the proposal, neither of which endorsed it -- to generally fund study of the upper atmosphere, and so there'd be some preparation if some other country went lunatic and actually tried dimming the sun.

If you know anyone at the NOAA, you know they were ravaged during the last administration, and they weren't really sufficiently funded before *that*.  Are they gonna sign on to almost anything that throws them funding?  Obviously.

From the *Guardian* article this thread is about:

*Outdoor experiments should be allowed only if they provide critical knowledge that cannot be obtained by other means, said the report, and the research programme “should not be designed to advance future deployment of these interventions”.*

"&gt;Why are cops who aren't on duty even allowed to carry weapons?

I've known a few cops, from a few different states and jurisdictions.  Many times, as I was told by them, departments require their officers to carry guns and badges, even off duty, because they're technically on call for emergencies 24/7.  Or some such.  Admittedly it's been quite a few years since I'd had those conversations.  Still, it's plausible to think off duty officers have their badges and weapon with them.

And in states that allow concealed carry?  Normal citizens might be armed.  Not in MD, though.  And MD has a law that requires you to allow fleeing criminals to flee, unless during their flight they are still a present danger to your life or the lives of those around you.  Like, if they're firing a gun at you while trying to run away, or similar.

"People saying the rich will leave, especially leave to another country, might not have ever done that themselves. It's not that simple to leave, especially to move to another country.

To start, you're presuming they can move and considering COVID restrictions, immigration isn't a top concern. Secondly, you have to spend quite a bit of money moving so you simply do the math of what costs more: selling all your shit, buying housing elsewhere (though they could already own it), moving everything over. You also have not only the sights but friends in the area so if you're leaving, there's a good chance you'll be leaving your friends behind. Sure, you're rich so you can visit but is it easy to visit the US - again during COVID - once you've left the country (and presumably resigned your citizenship since the US still taxes on income even if you live overseas).

"Ill miss ol Phil. He was always good for a laugh with his endless gaffs on his national and international trips. 

Some of his classics:

 

&gt;On cultural differences  
&gt;  
&gt;“If you stay here much longer, you  will go home with slitty eyes,” he remarked to 21-year-old British  student Simon Kerby during a visit to China in 1986.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I would like  to go to Russia very much – although the bastards murdered half my  family,” he said in 1967 when asked if he would like to visit the Soviet  Union.  
&gt;  
&gt;“You can’t have been here that long, you haven’t got a pot belly,” said to a British tourist in Budapest , Hungary in 1993.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Aren’t most of you descended from pirates?” he asked residents of the Cayman Islands in 1994.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Do  you still throw spears at each other?” he asked Aboriginal leader  William Brin at the Aboriginal Cultural Park in Queensland in 2002.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the economy  
&gt;  
&gt;“A  few years ago, everybody was saying we must have more leisure,  everyone’s working too much. Now that everybody’s got more leisure time  they are complaining they are unemployed,” he said during the recession  in 1981.  
&gt;  
&gt;“All money nowadays seems to be produced with a natural  homing instinct for the Treasury,” he said talking about high taxes in  1963.  
&gt;  
&gt;“We go into the red next year… I shall probably have to give up polo,” he moaned about the Royal Family’s finances on US television  in 1969.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;On disability  
&gt;  
&gt;“Deaf? If you’re near there, no wonder you are  deaf,” he mused loudly to deaf children standing near a Caribbean steel drum band in 2000.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Do you know they have eating dogs for the  anorexic now?” he told a wheelchair-bound Susan Edwards with her guide  dog Natalie in 2002.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Do people trip over you?” he asked a wheelchair-bound nursing-home resident in 2002.  
&gt;  
&gt;“How  many people have you knocked over this morning on that thing?” he asked  mobility scooter user David Miller, a trustee of the Valentine Mansion  in Redbridge, in 2012.  
&gt;  
&gt;On women  
&gt;  
&gt;“British women can’t cook,” he told the Scottish Women’s Institute in 1961.  
&gt;  
&gt;“You are a woman, aren’t you?” he asked woman in Kenya in 1984.  
&gt;  
&gt;“People  think there’s a rigid class system here, but dukes have even been known  to marry chorus girls. Some have even married Americans,” he said in  2000.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Do you have any knickers in that material?” he asked  Scottish Tory leader Annabel Goldie in 2010, while they were admiring  tartan made for the Pope.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I don’t think a prostitute is more  moral than a wife, but they are doing the same thing,” he said  confusingly in 1988 when discussing blood sports.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Ah, so this is  feminist corner then,“ he asked a group of female Labour MPs whose name  badges read “Ms” at a Buckingham Palace drinks party in 2000.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Every  time I talk to a woman they say I’ve been to bed with her. Well I’m  bloody flattered at my age to think some girl is interested in me,” he  said in 2006.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I thought it was against the law these days for a woman to solicit,” he told a woman solicitor.  
&gt;  
&gt;“You’re  not wearing mink knickers, are you?” Philip ASKS fashion writer Serena  French at a World Wildlife Fund gathering in 1993.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I would be  arrested if I unzipped that dress,” he remarked to a well-wisher during a  Diamond Jubilee visit with the Queen to Bromley in Kent.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Who do you sponge off?” he asked women at a community centre in Barking and Dagenham in 2015.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Yak,  yak, yak; come on get a move on,” Prince Philip said to the Queen from  the deck of Britannia in Belize in 1994. Her Majesty was talking to her  hosts.  
&gt;  
&gt;On youth  
&gt;  
&gt;“Young people are the same as they always  were. They are just as ignorant,” he said while celebrating the 50th  anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh Awards scheme.  
&gt;  
&gt;“So who’s on drugs here?… HE looks as if he’s on  drugs,” he said referring to a 14-year-old member of a Bangladeshi youth  club in 2002.  
&gt;  
&gt;“You could do with losing a little bit of weight,” he told hopeful astronaut Andrew Adams, 13.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Holidays  are curious things, aren’t they? You send children to school to get  them out of your hair. Then they come back and make life difficult for  parents. That is why holidays are set so they are just about the limit  of your endurance,” he told schoolchildren in 2000.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;On Britain  
&gt;  
&gt;“How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?” he asked a Scottish driving instructor in 1995.   
&gt;  
&gt;“The  problem with London is the tourists. They cause the congestion. If we  could just stop the tourism, we could stop the congestion,” he said at  the opening of City Hall in 2002.  
&gt;  
&gt;“And what exotic part of the  world do you come from?” he asked Tory politician Lord Taylor of Warwick  in 1999. “Birmingham,” the MP replied.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Only a Scotsman can  really survive a Scottish education,” he said when he was made  Chancellor of Edinburgh University in November 1953.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the media  
&gt;  
&gt;“You have mosquitoes. I have the Press,” he joked to the matron of a hospital in the Caribbean in 1966.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Well,  that’s more than you know about anything else then,” he told Michael  Buerk, after the BBC newsreader said he did know about the Duke of  Edinburgh’s Gold Awards in 2004.  
&gt;  
&gt;“What are you doing here?” he  asked Simon Kelner, editor of The Independent, at Windsor Castle  reception in 2002. “I was invited, sir.” Philip: “Well, you didn’t have  to come.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Damn fool question!” he said derisively to BBC  journalist Caroline Wyatt after she asked the Queen how she was enjoying  her stay in Paris in 2006.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Where are you from?” he asked the editor of the Sun, before replying: “Oh, no…one can’t tell from the outside.”  
&gt;  
&gt;“Just take the f\*\*\*ing picture,” he told a photographer at the RAF club in 2015.  
&gt;  
&gt;On common people  
&gt;  
&gt;“You  bloody silly fool!” he exclaimed to an elderly car park attendant who  who didn’t recognise him at Cambridge University in 1997.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Oh! You  are the people ruining the rivers and the environment,” he told three  young employees of a Scottish fish farm at Holyrood Palace in 1999.  
&gt;  
&gt;“If  you travel as much as we do you appreciate the improvements in aircraft  design of less noise and more comfort. Provided you don’t travel in  something called Economy Class, which sounds ghastly,” he said to the  Aircraft Research Association in 2002.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Are you all one family?” he asked of multi-ethnic dance troupe Diversity at the Royal Variety Performance in 2009.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Is it a strip club?” he asked a female Sea Cadet who told him she worked in a nightclub.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Why don’t you go and live in a hostel to save cash?” he asked a penniless student in 1998.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The  Philippines must be half empty, you’re all here running the NHS,” he  said to a Filipino nurse at Luton and Dunstable University Hospital in  February 2016.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the Royal family  
&gt;  
&gt;“Tolerance is the one  essential ingredient … You can take it from me that the Queen has the  quality of tolerance in abundance,” he said, giving advice for a  successful marriage in 1997.  
&gt;  
&gt;“If it doesn’t fart or eat hay, she  isn’t interested,” the Prince said of his daughter, Princess Anne, who  competed as an equestrian athlete in the 1976 Olympics.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It looks like a tart’s bedroom,” he said of plans for the Duke and then Duchess of York’s house at Sunninghill Park.  
&gt;  
&gt;“My son…er…owns them,” he replied after being asked whether he knew the Scilly Isles.  
&gt;  
&gt;“It  looks like the kind of thing my daughter would bring back from her  school art lessons,” he said of “primitive” Ethiopian art in 1965.",1617967690.0,gtx2yth,t3_mnerf2,/r/news/comments/mnerf2/prince_phillip_has_died/gtx2yth/,1.0,1617982090.0,"t3_mnerf2, laugh, gaffs, trips, classics, differences, gt, eyes, year, student, visit, gt;“I, bastards, family, gt;“You, pot, belly, tourist, pirates, residents, spears, leader, economy, gt;“A, years, leisure, time, recession, money, instinct, taxes, gt;“We, polo, finances, television, gt;On, disability, wonder, children, steel, drum, band, dogs, anorexic, wheelchair, guide, dog, people, nursing, home, resident, morning, thing, mobility, scooter, user, trustee, women, woman, gt;“People, class, system, dukes, chorus, girls, knickers, material, tartan, prostitute, wife, blood, sports, corner, group, MPs, name, badges, party, gt;“Every, bed, age, girl, law, days, solicitor, mink, fashion, writer, gathering, dress, wisher, Queen, community, centre, yak, move, deck, hosts, youth, anniversary, scheme, drugs, member, club, bit, weight, astronaut, gt;“Holidays, things, school, hair, life, parents, holidays, limit, endurance, schoolchildren, natives, booze, test, driving, instructor, problem, tourists, congestion, tourism, opening, part, world, politician, education, media, mosquitoes, matron, hospital, newsreader, editor, reception, sir, fool, question, journalist, stay, gt;“Where, outside, gt;“Just, picture, photographer, car, park, attendant, gt;“Oh, rivers, environment, employees, fish, farm, improvements, aircraft, design, noise, comfort, dance, troupe, strip, nightclub, hostel, cash, penniless, nurse, gt;“Tolerance, ingredient, quality, tolerance, abundance, advice, marriage, hay, daughter, athlete, tart, ’s, bedroom, plans, house, gt;“My, son, gt;“It, kind, art, lessons",0.3943236714975845,0.06875164690382085,1.0

"Reading the article and its reporting on how the police are searching for a motive, I realized I DON'T CARE. Let them search so they can figure out what degree of murder to charge this motherfucker with, but the changes we need to make are immediate and obvious.

1. Victim-centered reporting. This example is made up but could very well be real because it isn't an uncommon story. ""Lucy, aged 34, was murdered today by her ex boyfriend against whom she had a restraining order. Police records show that Lucy had reported her ex Rat Bastard, 44, for stalking and violent threats 5 times in the last 7 months but was told there was nothing to be done for her. 'I don't understand why Rat could buy a gun,' her grieving mother Marta, 68, told Victim First News Network. 'Obviously, he wanted to hurt my poor Lucy.' 

Lucy had just opened a new catering business in the Fort Worth area and was expecting a child with her fiance.""

Which brings me to

2. I don't give a flying fuck what the killer's motives are, and you should all stop caring as well. His motives were to kill people with the killing machine in his hands. The real thing we need to do is to make it harder for people with violent backgrounds to own a firearm. Do you have a restraining order against you? No gun.

"I'm an introvert, and hanging out with people is exhausting. The pandemic has been shockingly convenient for me. 

I usually dislike holidays and large family gatherings. Well, no more family gatherings to keep my elderly family safe, and holidays have been really low-key, just like I like them.

I often feel too tired to go out and socialize, so I make excuses when people invite me somewhere. Well, friends no longer ask to hang out every single week, so no need to make excuses. Even if I did have to make an excuse, ""Sorry, global pandemic + I care for elderly family members"" is both handy and true.

I dislike random pop-ins.  Well, nobody dares to just pop-in anymore.

I even like masks. They're like a license to be lazy. Instead of shaving every day, I shave like once a week, usually right before an online meeting.

I got my first 100% remote job during the pandemic, and I fucking love it. I really hope remote work continues to be wildly accepted after this shit is under control. I work in the video game industry, and studios have already been working with partner studios and/or contractors from different cities / states / countries / continents for many years now, and yet remote work for individuals was almost never an option before because of some stupid reason or another.

"I agree they probably didn't get more productive, or rare, but their value in a fast paced environment may have changed.

I do agree that 10 is a huge change, and I do agree that is odd, but the question is what has driven it, not to immediately assume ""now"" is the issue.

I'm not sure why you think hedge funds are paying directors. Could you please elaborate on that a little bit?

Companies being offered incentives to set up in particular places is not a US issue, and is a direct symptom of q lack of supra national tax regulations. I've explicitly said I agree that is an issue. However, in the UK for example you can pay into your pension through salary sacrifice (saving NI and student loan payments) or after those payments. Would you judge those people equally harshly for avoiding those tax burdens?

Ethically, it's the same thing.

I agree wealth disparity is a concern, it should be a perpetual concern. Like anything, it has the ability to slowly, steadily get worse. However, blanket rules are not sensible. Like people claiming increased income tax is a solution. No, wealth tax is bette income tax acts as a hindrance to social mobility and does little to tax the truly wealthy. Similiar principle here. Don't tax revenue, as some industries will be decimated, and pass it directly onto the consumer. Eg fuel in the UK is always seen as ""too dear"". But the TOTAL profit in the distribution chain from buying in raw materials to blend, distribution, forecourt profits etc is about 1-2%. Adding an additional revenue tax would just mean it gets directly passed onto the customer.

The US being ground 0, I personally feel, is more about the US culture than any kind of global shift.

I'm bringing other taxes up specifically to address the ""don't pay tax for the infrastructure they use"" point. Many services are split out another way. Road tax for example, addresses road use. The insane amount of taxes on fuel also address this. I agree corporation tax is the focus, but to suggest companies don't pay towards infrastructure because of one tiny part of their tax liabilities is just not representative. Roads, police etc aren't funded only by corporation tax. Therefore, by making the conversation about those, you make the conversation about tax as a whole.

Whilst I agree lobbying is an issue, ultimately they aren't the people casting lost of the votes. Climate change is a great example. In the constituencies that the green party run in, they tend to average less than 5% of the votes. Do you think that's because people don't care about climate change? Or because people fundamentally recognise that they will need to pay more tax?

Similiar thing with corporation tax. People are outraged that the companies will pay, in their view, tiny amounts of tax. But they also know that deep down it will largely be passed onto them by the companies if tax does increase. So they don't vote for drastic change. Also, even if drastic change does happen, it will just drive businesses away. See the point I made earlier about supra national entities. 

I'd agree the US is a good poster child for these issues, but there are more troubling issues that are more forward looking in my opinion. Ireland, for example, offering major tax incentives which has got them in trouble with the EU. You have mentioned the Netherlands, also Luxembourg has a reputation for it. Regarding wealth disparity, the UK is well known for being a tax haven, and even after Brexit was voted on, actively resisted efforts to tighten tax legislation on an EU level.

BEPS (base erosion profit shifting, ie shifting profits to other jurisdictions to saveoney) always has, and always will be an issue. You're right, in saying the EU is taking a stand, which is why I believe supra national entities can work.

The problem is, it's kind of a prisoner's dilemma. ""If I have good infrastructure, why would I NOT want to use that, and favourable tax, to attract companies?"" Is how well established nations will be thinking. 10% of 100b is better than 20% of 50b, because of the additional labour, and therefore spending, caused by it.

Ultimately, my point is that it's a complicated issue, that is messy to debate (especially via text). But ""higher corp tax"" isn't really the way to go about it. It's a very blunt tool, to get a very specific effect. Tackling rules around BEPS/tax bases is crucial, but so is addressing the other costs around it. A government should incentives higher productivity and R&amp;D, as this drives society forward. Balance that with things like tackling minimum wage, and addressing taxes paid based on employees, or business rate, tweaking VAT, paid time off, incentives for charity days (as these can improve work/life balance, and therefore health), having tax breaks for things like R&amp;D, but then have some sort of automation tax to tax the benefits. Once they break even on that project, they are then taxes at 10% of the gains from it for example.

"Did you not read the article I sent? Let's again look at what experts, not you or me or tech-politics journalists have to say, but the actual people who are, well, the experts. Let's see, without even me adding more sources, what my earlier one which you obviously didn't read had to say. I will not repeat mentioning payroll taxes since I already have. 

In the article you linked, it was claimed that Amazon payed $1 billion in federal tax and income expense (which I assume you included in ""$3B for TY2019 at the minimum""). My source has already replied to it, you just didn't read it. TL;DR its about a tenth of that.

""Lastly, the company claims “over $1 billion of federal income tax expense.” But most of that is what accountants call a deferred tax liability, meaning Amazon has not yet paid it. Amazon reports a *current* federal income tax of just $162 million in 2019, meaning that is what Amazon paid in 2019. The company reports that it deferred $914 million of federal taxes to future years.""

Let's look at the $9 billion in sales and duties. 

 ""Amazon merely collected sales taxes from customers and sent those tax payments to state and local governments. In fact, Amazon is a late arrival to the sales tax compliance scene. While Amazon has been collecting state sales tax in every state that levies one since 2017, the company was dragged kicking and screaming into the sales-tax-paying community over two decades, during which it made \*not\* collecting sales taxes the main source of its competitive advantage. And the company is still doing its best to avoid collecting local sales taxes and to avoid collecting any tax on [sales made through its affiliates](https://itep.org/a-lump-of-coal-for-12-states-not-collecting-marketplace-sales-taxes-this-holiday-season/).""

I found this, so just for [fun](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-pay-enough-taxes-source-says-local-tax-bill-297m-last-year/) I'll talk about it. In the article you linked, it was claimed that Amazon payed billions in state and local taxes. But in the article I linked, from the same newspaper, *the same author*, a trusted source said it was around a quarter billion. What changed? Why is this source with ""knowledge of the matter"" now not with knowledge of the matter? No explanation was given. (BTW, that is around the number I calculated.)

Obviously Amazon pays taxes, what matters is how much (in relation to the standard), at what time, and what happens after the fact.

The people who are not ""clamoring to have them set up shop in *their* town over someone else's"" are the actual workers, customers, and smaller businesses. According to Payscale's 2018 turnover rate ranking, Amazon is second to last. The average employment time is 1 year. [Amazon has not one but two patents for tracking employee productivity](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/amazon-wins-patents-wireless-wristbands-track-warehouse-workers/), [they are fully aware drivers are forced to pee or at times defecate while driving](https://theintercept.com/2021/03/25/amazon-drivers-pee-bottles-union/). [Whenever Amazon comes to town, the average wages for all warehouse workers fall for some reason](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/01/20/what-amazon-does-to-wages).

I am not against subsidizing or helping specific companies, but I am against all that Amazon stands for or that they do, and against the governments actions regarding so.

"You're lying.

Those two parties said they have no problems with buying Sputnik if it gets approval from EMA and even suggested we could run a clinical trials to help EMA get data.

Nobody in Slovakia is against Sputnik, there are just people opposed to blindly allowing any vaccine without necessary data and following the same rules for all vaccines. 

It's hilarious that Russia threw a hissy fit after Slovak government lab made analysis of what they actually received. It's hilarious that somehow checking things in lab is breach of contract because it's not ""EU"" certified. All EU certified labs refused to even analyse it because they're busy with approved vaccines.  
Seems like T&amp;C with Sputnik is to not ask questions and simply inject it into people, everything else voids the contract.

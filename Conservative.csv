Again, why keep them on there if they are dead.  One person one vote, right? They are dead, and there is no need to keep them there.

"Muni-fiber is done by small towns and cities that have been underserved by the big companies who basically refuse to install or upgrade their equipment to serve people in those communities.

"I guess I'm the sole person that actually read the article?  The ""Biden tie"" is a fairly misleading title... the ""tie"" is that the contract was given to a former transition team member.  Not even a staffer or personal friend, just a transition team member.  

So who is this transition team member? Well, even the article goes over their pretty impressive resume given the project:

* Worked at ICE from 2008 to 2019

* Said job at ICE eventually resulted in their overseeing operations across 39 states in providing child welfare services

* While on the transition team, they vetted appointees for the Department of Health and Human Services

So what about the organization that won the contract under him? Well, they've been around for 50+ years, they're Texas-based (specifically San Antonio), and their main focus since ~2007 has been housing, job training, homeless prevention, mental health services, and more.  Prior to this, they spent 30+ years launching food banks and health services for youths and elderly.  They've furthermore taken contracts from numerous government organizations over the years and have exceeded all expectations.  Is this a big contract for them? Sure.  Is this out of their expertise?

"&gt;To me, it seems pretty clear that Chauvin's actions contributed to Floyd ODing and that's manslaughter.

I'm confused... How did Chauvin's actions contribute to Floyd ODing? Floyd taking fentanyl contributed to the OD, nothing Chauvin did contributed. Or do you mean lack of actions?

For 2nd degree manslaughter, you have to prove that Chauvin acted with gross negligence. Gross negligence requires beyond a reasonable doubt that Chauvin should have known that his behavior might cause Floyd's death. Well how many times has a knee on the neck/shoulder been used on various suspects, and how many of them died? The prosecution's own witness (during cross-exam) stated he used this exact same tactic when he was an officer. Also, during the same cross-exam, the witness said that the officer has to deem the area safe before paramedics can come in, and the witness said that it would be reasonable for a cop to assume that the area is not safe yet when there is literally a mob of people shouting obscenities and threating the officers..

I'm not saying 2nd degree manslaughter isn't a possible conviction, but it's for sure not ""pretty clear"".",1617910228,gtuhe1k,t1_gtubtho,/r/Conservative/comments/mmur7z/ben_shapiro_warns_media_are_paving_the_way_for/gtuhe1k/,1,1617924628.0

"But manslaughter doesn’t just mean you did something that indirectly led to a death. It means you had to be grossly negligent and/or display utter disregard for human life. 

So even if Chauvin did exacerbate the effects of the drugs, that doesn’t necessarily prove manslaughter. 

Somebody near be could have a heart condition, but I’m not guilty of manslaughter if I startle them into a heart attack by shouting when a bee stings me. But if I knew they had a heart condition and I snuck up on them from behind and intentionally tried to scare them, then I might be guilty of manslaughter. 

Right now, the defense is winning the point that Chauvin acted reasonably given the situation. The defense lawyer even got the prosecution’s own witnesses to testify to that. If the prosecution loses that point, then manslaughter likely goes out the window with it.",1617910209,gtuhcgq,t1_gtubtho,/r/Conservative/comments/mmur7z/ben_shapiro_warns_media_are_paving_the_way_for/gtuhcgq/,0,1617924609.0

"From the article:

&gt; Prosecutors promising easier bail and fewer criminal prosecutions have swept to power in several big cities in recent years, but a backlash may be underway as crime spikes. Witness last week's developments in Philadelphia.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;On March 31 **the Democratic City Committee voted not to endorse incumbent District Attorney Larry Krasner for May's primary election.** He won in 2017 after denouncing the city's police and prosecutors as ""both systemically racist"" and has spent his time in office **touting his efforts ""to end mass incarceration"" by bringing fewer charges and urging lighter sentences.** But Mr. Krasner now faces a primary challenge from Carlos Vega, a former homicide prosecutor whom he fired.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**In December 2020, Mr. Krasner filed 525 charges for violent crimes, compared to 757 in December 2017**, the month before he took office. **The decrease doesn't reflect a safer city**; nearly 500 people were murdered in Philadelphia last year, compared to 315 in 2017. Last year saw more than 2,200 shootings, and the vast majority of victims were black. Auto thefts have risen sharply, with some 9,295 vehicles stolen last year compared to 5,694 in 2017. ""**Victims are an inconvenient truth that Larry ignores**,"" Mr. Vega told Philadelphia Weekly in December. ""He never talks about the victims."" Mr. Vega says he's running ""to make our city safer.""  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**In poor, minority neighborhoods, backlash against Mr. Krasner is building**. Philadelphia is a machine-politics city where incumbents generally get an endorsement, but many of the ward leaders who make up Philadelphia's Democratic City Committee feared that backing Mr. Krasner would turn off voters and hurt their preferred judicial candidates",1617908766,gtue0je,t3_mmyx95,/r/Conservative/comments/mmyx95/softoncrime_backlash_philadelphia_democrats_voted/gtue0je/,1,1617923166.0

"And not everyone can just get an I.D. Some people are homeless and don't have the money, some people live in areas where the nearest DMV is too far and they don't have a car or public transportation, some people can't dedicate a day at the one DMV in their town to hopefully get an ID while missing out on work.

It's not complicated, for me or you, but it can be for others who don't have the same means. 

Your rights shouldn't cost money to get.

What's great is you don't currently need only a drivers license or states license to vote, you can use a passport, birth certificate, social security card, military ID, school ID, etc. 

Voter ID cards is trying to make it so you can only vote with that ID, instead of the plethora of other forms of identification that we use use. Those forms being able to be used because not everyone has the same circumstance. 

It's funny you say I'm making it complicated when limiting the forms of identification to just 1 instead of 5 - 10 is making it complicated for some people to vote / get because it doesn't take into account the multitudes of situations people can be in.

"&gt; We vote for said GOP reps who keep Mitch in power. So we are the root cause of this problem.

that is always the root problem. As a whole congress has a truly terrible approval rate for both sides of the aisle. But each side just keeps voting in the same people over and over again. Part of that is party chicanery during the primaries to keep people the party heads like. The other is gerrymandering to an extreme extent in some states. 

The gerrymandering issue results in safe districts. Then suddenly in your solid district, it isn't really who is the candidate who appeals to the most people. It is the candidate who appeals only the most to that subset of people. Then it isn't left/right it is far-left vs left. Gerrymandering is a big source of why our politics are so divided currently.

He also runs with some stories and is not careful enough. In Endgame: Blueprint For Global Enslavenent, he made a lot of important points, but peppered within those points he made claims that ""they are releasing spider goat hybrids into the wild."" iirc.

Now scientices have put spider DNA into goats to get them to produce spider silk in their teets (is that the proper term?) in larger quantities. And there is certainly an important question about what we ought to do with the animals we tamper with like that. And there is also certainly concern for immoral DNA experiments that scientists most assuredly are doing without public knowledge.

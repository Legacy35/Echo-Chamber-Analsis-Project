Funny i dont hear biden on a soap box blathering about it daily and claiming mexico is going to pay for it. Maybe he will after he drains the swamp.,1617921393.0,gtv6ic8,t1_gtv587c,/r/Conservative/comments/mmqqhd/breaking_governor_greg_abbott_opens_investigation/gtv6ic8/,1.0,1617935793.0,,,,
"No, because before now businesses and institutions didn't care about the flu. They now have certain guidelines they have to comply with (e.g. a certain number of employees testing positive= you have to shut down for two weeks), so it makes sense they'd want to take steps to minimize the likelihood of that happening. In states where those guidelines don't exist, there is still a lot of social/economic pressure for businesses to verify vaccine status of their patrons (e.g. other people may be more likely to go there if passports are required). 

The bottom line is that there's plenty of legal precedent for private businesses to have any requirements of entry they want. They're allowed to require certain clothes or styles of dress, that their patrons be of a certain age, or that everyone have a tattoo of a money on their buttcheek. The only thing they can't do is discriminate against a protected class. At the federal level, these are currently defined as race, color, country of origin, religion, sex/orientation, disability, and family status. Personal ethics/politics/preferences about vaccines is not a protected class. 

Some people may try to argue a ""religious"" opposition to vaccines, but in reality there are no organized religious groups that don't allow them. I know that religion is personal to everyone, but it would be very hard to prove legally that a preference for not being vaccinated is due to your religion. And there is already pecedent for vaccination status not being tied to religion in this way, as several states do not have religious or personal exemptions to vaccines for school entry (meaning kids can be turned away from public schools if their families choose not to vaccinate). 

As for the disability class, it is possible that some people's inability to be vaccinated is due to a physical disability or medical condition. There are already discussions being had about how to exempt those individuals from the passport. The reality is though, for that small group of medically fragile people, they are likely not interacting with the public any time soon, regardless of passports. If your immune system is too jacked for a non-live vaccine, it's still just way too dangerous right now for them to risk exposure in public.",1617921385.0,gtv6hq3,t1_gtqc682,/r/Conservative/comments/mm1c64/another_governor_just_banned_government_mandated/gtv6hq3/,1.0,1617935785.0,,,,

"I laugh at people who say Trump was a Russian spy. The intelligence committee, Robert Mueller’s report, and even a GOP lead senate panel provided reports with evidence of russia not only interfering in the 2016 election but having ties to the trump campaign. Trump had so many nicknames and terrible things to say about every world leader except Putin. Why do you think that is? Why do you think he publicly sided with Putin over the US Intelligence Agency who had evidence of Russia interfering in the 2016 elections? Why do you think Trump never once denounced or took action against Russia for putting bounties on US soldiers heads? Sounds like republicans bury their heads in the sand to the facts and evidence because it doesn’t fit their narrative.


On January 6, Trump said “we are going to walk down and I’ll be there with you. We are going to walk down to the Capitol. We are going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong.” I agree that some of them headed towards the capitol during his speech but all the rest of his supporters went after his speech per his direction.

“Were there voting irregularities and a need to legislatively codify some of the court ordered pandemic voting allowances?
— Sure

Do the poor (disproportionately minority) systematically have a harder time voting due to any restrictions that require time and money?
— Sure

Do either the Republicans or Democrats want to give up the ability to pander to their base about fears over voting issues and have common sense solutions to fix problems in our democracy?
— Unlikely

Why not free IDs printed in local communities in travelling minibuses?

Why not proportional voting in multi-seat districts to completely do away with gerrymandering?

Why not ranked choice or STAR voting to allow voters to find candidates who actually serve their interests?

We already had our policies. They were working. Team DNC came in and immediately undid them while signalling from the get-go that they would do exactly that. We are witnessing the extremely-predictable result.

"its hard to know without actually seeing the contract, but in general, its not unusual for bidders on a contract to front load a contract, or some other similar form of shifting money around.

what i mean is (this is all generally speaking. experience may vary based on contracts), contractors get paid as they complete work, so they may jack up the bid cost to perform early tasks.  for example, if im building a playground, i may say that the early earthwork costs more than it actually does so that i get paid more money earlier in the job.

however, under normal bid jobs, this doesnt do you any favors against competition.  so to balance out higher earlier charges, you lower the charges for later work (think finishing, final detail work).  In the end, your *total* bid is whats important, not the details of how you came to that number.

Who cares if you charge $25k for a hammer, if you charge $10 for a new car, vs charging $10 for a hammer and $25k for the car.

no-bid jobs though are a bit trickier, but you would still have to look at all the line items and the entire final cost to figure out if the total costs were reasonable.",1617919079.0,gtv1lee,t1_gttsyk9,/r/Conservative/comments/mmowyb/dave_chappelle_says_celebrities_left_dirty_notes/gtv1lee/,1.0,1617933479.0,,,,

"I’m not sure I see the relevance. Vermont ranks around 30-40 re: all 50 states (1 highest / 50 lowest) relative to gun deaths. Between 2008-2017, 670 people were killed in VT by guns. On average there is 11 firearm deaths per 100,000 people annually. It had the 19th highest rate among states of guns sold in the state (VT) that are later used in crimes in other states over 2008-2017. Certainly, VT’s relatively highly educated and wealthy population (overall poverty rate of 11.7%) has an impact in all violent crime rates. It ranks middle of the pack in terms of overall gun ownership (28.8% of population). Compare to Alaska, which has highest rate of gun deaths, at 61.7% gun ownership. 

So again I’m not sure I see the relevance. VT with its smaller, highly educated, wealthier population, experiences less gun violence than other states, but it is no means free from it. In fact, the data lines up quite well — mid/high rates of gun violence relative to population correlating with mid/high levels of gun ownership.

1) it is not uncommon for suspects to regain consciousness and become even more agitated and combative. Just because Floyd was unconscious didn’t mean that he did not have the potential to become a physical threat again in a moment’s notice  

2) Officers are not expected to begin medical treatment if the situation is unsafe to do so. The increasingly hostile crowd made it unsafe. Especially when you considered Floyd would have to be rolled over and have the handcuffs removed for chest compressions to begin 

3) In fact, the scene was so hostile that the ambulance that arrived had to do a “load and scoot”. That means they were unable to render immediate life-saving measures on the scene because it was unsafe to do so, thus leading to an additional delay in Floyd’s medical treatment. In addition to that, because the ambulance had to relocate due to the load and scoot, the firefighters that were called to the scene had difficulty finding the ambulance in its relocation thus causing even more delay. 

In short, Floyd ingesting drugs was the most likely cause of his cardiopulmonary arrest, but the hostile crowd significantly dimished Floyd’s chances of survival with their interference.

&gt; It's the very visible thought process behind his speech that is concerning

What thought process? You realize when he rambles that's just his way of filling the time while he thinks of an answer to the original question right? Most politicians don't even both to answer the question, they will give a canned response as their ""ramble"" and that's it. At least with Trump you can ask him and he'll answer the question, and if he rambles too much just ask him again right after and he'll give you a direct answer now that he's had time to think. I've seen it many times.

"&gt;Why not?

Is this a serious question? Why wouldn't we allow illegals, whom we have zero criminal history on, to go where ever they please within our country?

&gt;How is that the best approach? Especially when they won't have a hearing for months or years?

Because those who break our federal immigration law and defy our soverignty do not deserve to be within our borders until their hearing i.e. illegals.

&gt;Why though?

Again, is this a *serious* question? Are you asking why we shouldn't allow people to freely cross into our country whereever the please?

&gt;What is the argument for making immigration illegal?

Not sure what you mean by this. Illegal immigration should be illegal due to safety and health concerns not to mention assimilation issues. *Legal* immigration is a thing and should continue to be a thing in my opinion.

&gt;But I don't know of any argument for why it should be illegal to want to move somewhere else. I mean, ultimately the inability to apply or be approved for a visa is what causes illegal entry.

You are making arguments towards things I have never mentioned. I will reiterate that due tonhealth and safety reasons crossing our border illegally should remain illegal, not to mention the fact that we need to control numbers of individuals that enter our country, we can not take whoever wants to come here. And please don't excuse illegal behavior, it makes you look silly.

&gt;Because Mexico also has issues and safety concerns of it's own?

"Your comment is conflating a few things which are better addressed individually.

First, how many of the perpetrators in your links were abusing dead voters on the voting registration lists? By my count, of what you posted so far, none. So yeah, the voter registration issue shows clerical errors so far, not fraud. The data constantly erodes over time without malfeasance (no one is intentionally ""keeping dead voters there"").

Second, as stated above, I agree with the point that dead people don't belong on voter registration lists. The question is how dangerous is the potential for abuse - where should fixing the issue go in our national priorities. It's my opinion that individually-falsified votes is a non-issue compared to the larger systemic issues with our electoral integrity (eg, electronic voting machines which have a pretty high risk of abuse and hit way more than one vote at a time, foreign media campaigns targeting voters with misinformation, the rise of social media as de facto political turf with unbridled partisan hatred breeding extremism, etc). These are orders of magnitude more important, in my prioritization.

Third, you're levying a ""racism"" attack at someone who has not used an argument related to race. Think about that for a second. You're so aggrieved that people might use ""race"" as a bad faith argument, that you are now actually using ""race"" as a bad faith argument.

I agree that we need to pursue election integrity and that it should be a non-partisan issue. I just see [zero proof](https://ballotpedia.org/Votes_cast_in_the_names_of_deceased_people) that dead people on the voting registration lists should be registering anywhere near the top of that list of priorities. So what I see in OP's article linked above, and echoed continually in this thread, is a mass hysteria machine attempting to leverage half the country against the other half about a non-issue. This lawsuit is not a significant development in the fight for election security.

"Dude. You are saying that because something wasn't proven it couldn't have existed. There was basically no effort to discover voter fraud, no serious effort by the people who could maybe uncover it. Also, again, the people who could discover it are likely to be the ones involved.

The election system is run poorly, it is not secure, it needs to be overhauled. Nobody should have to prove that there was voter fraud, the government should be able to prove that there couldn't be voter fraud. 

Go research the voting systems in Europe and Australia, then honestly examine the claims being made by democrats, ignore your own bias and the indisputable bias of the media, and then decide for yourself if we really shouldn't be doing anything and if it is moral to get angry at people that want secure elections. 

People aren't inventing the suspicious stuff that happened in this past election, and frankly the explanations that were provided for a lot of it wouldn't be believed by anyone who isn't an idiot. Democrats claimed that Russia stole the election for Trump because they bought Facebook ads. Yet all the counting stops (and middle of the night resuming), massive delays, removal of counting monitors, covering of windows at counting facilities, that is considered to be a non-issue.

"President Biden has pitched his nearly $2.3 trillion spending proposal as a vital investment in the U.S. economy, but the proposed tax hikes that would fund the sweeping measure could kill close to 1 million jobs. 

That's according to a study released Thursday by the National Association of Manufacturers, which found that 1 million jobs will disappear within two years if the president's proposed tax increases are approved.

""This study tells us quantitatively what manufacturers from coast to coast will tell you qualitatively: increasing the tax burden on companies in America means fewer American jobs,"" said NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons.

The Treasury Department on Wednesday released details of Biden's tax plan, which aims to raise $2.5 trillion over 15 years to finance his sweeping spending initiative, dubbed the American Jobs Plan. That includes raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, imposing a new minimum tax on global profits and cracking down on companies that try to move profits offshore.

But boosting taxes on corporations could shrink the nation's GDP by $117 billion in 2023 and $190 billion in 2026, according to the study, conducted by Rice University economists John Diamond and George Zodrow. Those figures assumed a repeal of the 20% deduction for pass-through businesses, increasing the top income tax rate and raising the corporate tax rate to 28%. 

""The conclusion of this study is inescapable—follow through with tax hikes that give other countries a clear advantage and we’ll see far fewer jobs created in America,"" Timmons said.

The tax increases would fund massive investments in the nation's roads and bridges, as well as transit systems, schools and hospitals. 

But the White House is already facing headwinds over the proposal: Both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable, which is comprised of CEOs from some of the nation's biggest companies, warned that forcing corporations to pay more in federal taxes would ultimately derail the economy's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.

Biden indicated on Wednesday that he's willing to lower the proposed corporate tax increase amid pushback from Republicans and some moderate Democrats, who have raised concerns that the tax increases could derail the economy's recovery from the pandemic and hurt U.S. competitiveness abroad.

""I'm willing to listen to that,"" Biden said when asked at the White House whether he would consider a corporate tax rate lower than 28%. ""I'm wide open. But we've got to pay for this. There are many other ways we could it. But I'm willing to negotiate that.""

The corporate tax increase would generate about $740 billion in new revenue over the next decade, according to a recent analysis published by the Tax Policy Center.

"No, it does - government regulatory bodies literally create agreements with those telecoms that bar other providers from entering their local areas.  In the face of new entrants making inroads in various regions, they convinced regulators that the best way to serve the public was to block duplication of effort. Why build new trenches or lay new lines when perfectly good ones already existed?

Health care, mass transit and utility executives use similar claims to gain special access to government favors.

I was also surprised to see how seemingly smart the guy is. Lastly, I was amazed at how much he apparently cares about America and the average American.

"They're not just wiring money to governments. The vast majority of aid is distributed through NGOs and non-profits.

&gt;Only a small portion of US foreign assistance goes directly to governments (known as bilateral aid). In 2017 (most recent complete data as of 2020), USAID reports that less than 3% of all foreign aid disbursements went directly to governments. The other 97% goes to a combination of multilateral organizations (like the United Nations or World Bank), nonprofits, and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

that's not the standard.

[This is](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.205):

&gt; A person who causes the death of another ... by the person's culpable negligence whereby the person creates an unreasonable risk, and consciously takes chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another

""Whether Floyd would be alive"", i.e. ""causes the death"", is only a small part of the equation. You also have to prove that the risk was unreasonable, that Chauvin was negligent, that he's culpable for the negligence, and that he was conscious of the risk.

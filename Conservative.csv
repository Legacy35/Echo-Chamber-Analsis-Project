"I do work in the social media marketing space and there’s a really low probability that it’s him. Just like all the other politicians and most entertainers have social media managers and don’t post themselves. It’s also unlikely that Trump is up late at night clipping together campaign videos on Adobe Premiere.

A business person would know to hire out in areas where you know an expert would be beneficial. Companies hire social media managers all the time and there are a lot of metrics that can be tracked via Twitter Insights.

I remember seeing a tweetstorm in the rDT account. It was a bunch of different ideas within a few minutes. 2nd amendment, abortion, border wall, etc. Each one was being tracked by social media managers to find out what demographic is interested in what messages to better craft the campaign.

This is a public image of a very public individual.  Anyone in that position would outsource that work.

There are a number of articles about Dan Scavino’s role in the social media campaigns.  I’m pretty confident it is all him.

&gt; It’s whether any state makes it harder to vote for some residents in the state than other residents in the state. It does not.

You clearly did NOT read the article. ""Georgia’s new voting law reduces the number of ballot dropboxes to one per 100,000 voters in a county, or one per early voting site, whichever is fewer. For example, if a county has five polling locations but only 300,000 voters, it would only be allowed to have three dropboxes."" 

The intent behind this law is to make it harder for people in urban places to vote.

To really prevent that you gotta figure out how they're pulling it off. They can't just be walking around opening mailboxes and hoping there's a ballot in it; that's too conspicuous and you'd never get enough ballots. Somehow these people know:

* Which house is getting a ballot
* When the ballot gets delivered
* That they have clandestine access to the mailbox during the window between when it's delivered and the resident checks the mail
* That the resident wasn't already going to vote for their preferred candidate anyway
* That the resident won't report that the ballot didn't arrive

gtpnqy2,1617817480,4,t1_gtpn5mw,"The bill, known as SB 202, gives state-level officials the authority to usurp the powers of county election boards — allowing the Republican-dominated state government to potentially disqualify voters in Democratic-leaning areas. It criminalizes the provision of food and water to voters waiting in line, in a state where lines are notoriously long in heavily nonwhite precincts. It requires ID for absentee ballots and limits the placement of ballot drop boxes.

An analysis of data collected by Georgia Public Broadcasting and ProPublica found a significant disparity in who had to wait the longest: The average wait time after the 7 p.m. scheduled poll-closing time was 51 minutes in polling places that were 90% or more non-White. But it was just six minutes in polling places where 90% of the voters were White.

Voting rights advocates say that makes it all the more troubling that Georgia's law now makes it a misdemeanor to approach a voter in line to provide food or water.

-Voting hours and drop boxes

The law now requires officials to house drop boxes for absentee ballots inside early voting locations, which limits their usefulness. The law also specifies that early voting hours must run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., but it gives county registrars the flexibility to extend hours to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

Voting advocates argue that Black voters are more likely to work multiple jobs than Georgians of other races and limiting their access to drop boxes closes off yet another avenue to the franchise.

Voter challenges

The law says any Georgian can challenge the voting eligibility of an unlimited number of voters. Activists say this will make it to easier for conservative groups to attempt to purge large groups of Black voters or others they think will support Democrats.

Attempts to challenge voters' eligibility are not new. Ahead of January US Senate runoffs, Texas-based conservative organization True the Vote paired up with the Georgia Republican Party and tried to challenge more than 360,000 Georgia voters that it said may have changed addresses. Most counties declined to take up the matter.

Georgia's law adds a new provision that allows the State Elections Board to sanction counties that refuse to comply with the provision allowing unlimited challenges.

Just to clear some info up (not speaking for all Georgians, just family and friends from hometown) there’s not a real problem with voter IDs among people. (You might’ve seen the article floating around conservative   https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/poll-75-percent-americans-support-voter-ID )

A small hassle but sure whatever is the general response and most people already have a ID. This is a narrative created to combat what the real issue is. The problem is the voting hours, (people get off work at 5PM why close polling locations at 5PM? That’s sketch) , trying to stop souls to the polls (again what is wrong going to vote with your church family?), obviously making water illegal to handout. I don’t believe for one a second a person who is determined to wait in line for hours in this Georgia humid heat would be easily swayed to vote for the other candidate because he/she got a bottle of water. Everyone in GA (Atlanta/Savannah/Macon/mostly) knows how long it is to vote and usually comes prepared to wait for some time. Do you think that their minds could be changed when they already decided to vote for their candidate with the knowledge of the long lines?

Let’s be realistic here. Again. No one here (GA) really cares about voter ID that’s easy and simple and most people already have a valid form of ID. It’s the other things in the bill. 

You can’t seriously think a bill with as many pages as 300 is simply for voter ID.",/r/Conservative/comments/mm6g90/factcheck_colorado_makes_voting_far_easier_than/gtpnqy2/

Lines are crazy long here in Georgia. Not to mention the fact people work. People have kids. And most time those kids have to wait with their parents in line to vote. Last time I voted in Georgia it took almost two hours. And I got there early. Now think of all of those people who also got there early, but have obligations like idk... work, kids etc. Even if they got there early and planned things out it’s still not a guarantee that you will get in and out on time. Compare that to what I stated above where the average wait time after closed polls in non white communities is 51 minutes compared to 6 minutes in white communities. That was by design. 

Now let’s add making it illegal to had out water and snacks for people (adult and children) waiting in these long lines in this Georgia heat. 

How about we also limit the drop boxes to polling places only where we can conveniently close at 5PM, where most people get off work. Atlanta traffic is horrible btw. Damn... can’t make it in time to early vote. Which leads to Election Day voting, which leads to the issues I stated above, long ridiculous lines. 

Now let’s add challenging any voters eligibility to vote. Came to the wrong polling place? Disqualified. Wrong district? Disqualified. New address? Disqualified. Signature doesn’t match? Disqualified.

Now let’s sprinkle taking powers away from the SOS if you don’t like the outcome.

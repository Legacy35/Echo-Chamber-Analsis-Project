Anyhow, a few months later, the factory closed for good, and all of those jobs the factory supported, both indirectly and directly, were wiped out.  I'm told the factory was relocated to Mexico, but who knows.  These days, I often think about Mr. Striking For Job Security and if he realizes the irony of it all.

And that their off takes time is unknown. So if you take a 30 min bathroom break but it takes you 10 minutes to walk there, possibly wait for a stall to open, take a 10 - 5 min shit, god forbid a 15 minute shit, then walk that 10 min back to your area you’re gonna lose out and it’ll mark you as inefficient. They’re trying to treat humans as robots and that doesn’t work. I mean they even mark you off task of your manager has you walk or do something else.

"OK I'll bite. Firstly, I said notion, not fact or I believe. There are some who believe trump is not a conservative, wildcard, for the people politician as he's presented himself to be but rather is controlled globalist opposition who was put into power to further their causes through misdirection and manipulation. Me? I don't know what I believe. For most of his presidency, I operated under the premise that Trump is the enemy of my enemy and therefore my friend. But it was always a little suspect to me. His family connections, personal and business connections and past political opinions presented before he ran for office all gave me pause. I watched January 6 play out live via multiple live streams and most conservatives know what happened with that whole shit show, from his pointless meaningless speech that day to his spineless response afterwards and everything in between did not jibe with him being who his supporters thought him to be. Now he's lauding a known depopulation advocating globalist elite in a most slobbery way and this, to me, reinforces the notion that he was a controlled opposition Trojan horse. Here's a question for you...how have conservative concepts or ideas fared since trump? Have conservative stances been strengthened in our society or weakened since Trump? Are we more or less free? Are we more or less revered as an independent nation of leaders and strength around the world or are has our standing in the world stage declined?

"1. Altitude masks are not the same. They offer *airflow resistance* kinda simulating working out at higher altitudes. Masks that we wear every day can lead to a *build up of CO2* within the body and less O2 as the purpose is to disrupt airflow to avoid spreading airborne/droplet particles. Possibility for hypoxia or acidosis.

2. Reddit users who are ignorant think they are effective. What do altitude masks try to do? Simulate working out in different altitudes where the air is less dense therefore there is less oxygen. An athlete using this ONLY during training will recieve very little benefit if any. 

Unless you LIVE in a higher altitude environment or keep the mask on for months on end your body will not adjust.

"&gt;I have never heard of a ""ghost gun."" Are these in large circulation, enough to warrant a law on them? (that is guns that can be made at home with no serial number).

Basically, a ""ghost gun"" is a 'scary' term that is used to describe a gun that is made or built within your own home or property. These are (as of this time) completely legal to do (depending on state) so long as you are legally able to own a firearm. Think of it like a Parts kit car vs buying one from the dealer. With the parts kit you get to decide what components you all want, what it will look like, and you are the one who makes it. Same idea goes for a home made fire arm. People can 3D print the FRAME of a gun. Which is just the outside shell. NOT THE ACTUAL GUN ITSELF (in most cases). and then they will buy the parts, self assemble it, and use it.

these are not, to my knowledge, a huge issue in crimes that are committed and is an infringement on rights. Most of your crimes used store bought guns, which ALREADY go through a huge background check process. OR they buy them in a brown bag from some guy parked in an alley. Your typical criminal doesn't have interest in leaning how to assemble a gun, nor do they want to put in the effort in doing so. and again, the bulk of crimes committed are from an already illegally obtained weapon in the first place.

"I remember pointing out to a lady at my wife's work the true story behind the girl (the image of Trump looking down on her) on the cover on Time.  The co-worker had no idea.  The left doesn't just selectively show concern about these situations, they lie to their own supporters in order to manipulate them.

For those who don't know, the mother of the girl on the Time cover was married, had several children, and her husband had a decent job in their home country.  The father said there was no reason for his wife to go.  The mother though had ambitions to make more money by going to the US.  She took her youngest (the girl in the photo) against the father's wishes and without his knowledge.   It's heart breaking the risks the mother took with her child's life over greed.  The daughter was also never separated from the mother, even though Time initially said she was.

"Looking at history. Marxist “revolutionaries” generally go through the same trajectory: 

1. asking others to risk everything for the “revolution” with the promise of drastically improved lives for everyone.

2. If the “revolution” is unsuccessful, flee to a sympathetic foreign embassy to “persevere the sparks of revolution” while their pawns are getting slaughtered on the street.

3. If the “revolution” is successful, the leaders obviously “deserve” to become leaders of the new regime, preferably for life. They will purge some political rivals who are obviously “weak willed” and corrupted by capitalism. 

4. They tell the pawns that their lives will eventually be better, but hardships will have to be endured first, because the capitalist dogs will not want the revolution to succeed so they will try everything to hinder the progress. It’s only natural for the leaders of revolution to have a dacha and eat Adriatic figs while drinking imported wine. They need to keep their minds sharp to guide the continued revolution. Meanwhile, the “temporary” hardships for the masses are just temporary. One day, everyone will be able to enjoy a good life.

"It's conservatives voting away assistance and not picking up the slack. They're basically shooting themselves in the foot with it. The liberals in California pay for a ton of stuff in Kentucky and other poor red states. If all the public assistance went away, and people had to rely entirely on private donations, lots of people would die. 
If we continued on that way of thinking, there'd be no one to maintain roads, or private companies would do it, but that would significantly drive up the cost of travel, and in turn the cost of goods.

There's also a difference in where donations go. Conservative donations are quite often to churches and politicians, while liberal donations go more often to nonprofits and foundations. Churches generally have a small area impact, meaning poor areas would be underserved and rich areas would be much better, similar to the situation with public schools funded by local taxes.

"The term you're looking for is ""straw man"", but it doesn't apply to my argument. It only applies to arguments that are UNNECESSARILY extreme.

But suggesting that EVERY gun law, absolutely, is an unconstitutional infringement is, by definition, the most extreme position you can hold. I'm not exaggerating the position.

If you believe that literally every gun law is unconstitutional (""shall not be infringed""), then you MUST therefore believe that you should be able to own and use personal nuclear and chemical weapons.

If you, like almost everybody, believe it would be insane to let people have nerve gas for home defense, then you DO NOT believe that the ""shall not be infringed"" part is actually binding, that we CAN infringe on the 2A when it comes to some types of weapons. You just disagree with liberals as to which types of weapons are okay to ban. AR-15s are okay to you, but anthrax would not be.

Even though the 2A doesn't distinguish between them.

Almost no conservative is as loyal to the 2A as they think they are. They're right here in the legal mud trying to figure out an appropriate limitation to it as any liberal is.

"What are you talking about? If people thought he was ""low substance"" his TV show ""The Apprentice"" would've been a failure, instead it was a huge success. A show called ""The Apprentice"" doesn't work if the veteran star is seen as an incompetent buffoon...

Public opinion of his competence was very positive before he ran for president as a Republican, you just made shit up because you can't remember what it was like before you were bombarded by all the propaganda. He was always seen as a no-nonsense tell-it-like-it-is guy who could cut through the BS to get to the substance of what matters.

The perception you're thinking of was only created once he began his campaign, and the idea was pushed that he didn't know anything about politics or government and thus would be incompetent at the job. Then that morphed into general incompetence as the media slowly told their center to left minions how to think about the guy and carefully chose what parts of his day they would tell you about.

Deep down you know I'm right. You know you didn't watch a single round table of his during the entire four years. You're like someone who passes on an idea because it ""sounds dumb"" and then someone else takes it up and makes billions. Superficial analysis, absolutely zero critical thinking skills. A basic smell test tells you that someone who is ""low substance"" wouldn't be even remotely as successful as Trump was, let alone in the face of the alliance of institutional power that was directed against him. In his last months in office he was bringing peace to the middle east in deals that all the ""experts"" said would never be agreed to and were a lost cause.

"Population density, homogeneous society, gun education, even what ""gun violence"" is &amp; how it is counted all contribute to the differences between countries. Plus a host of other factors that I haven't mentioned.

Besides all that, there's the nonsense of myopically looking at only ""gun violence"" rather than all violence, or even crime overall.

For example, say that you magically take away all guns &amp; gun homicide drops from 2000 per year to zero. Is that a good outcome?

"You don’t understand that reasonable articulable suspicion that a crime has been committed, is being committed or is about to be committed is required to detain a person in the US. 

A poll worker worker at a no voter ID state challenging your ballot and you failing to provide an ID or other documentation is not considered reasonable suspicion that voter fraud has occurred. The cop would have no authority to detain you and take you downtown for fingerprints or to your supposed address to verify your info. 

If this were the case, with how hard the GOP has gone after voter fraud recently, wouldn’t this have happened numerous times at every location that didn’t require ID. It didn’t because this is not how the process works. If so we would have had hundreds or thousands of voters lined up to have cops verify their information after they voted without ID. 

Do you think it’s less intrusive to ask for an ID before they vote or ask them to sign an affidavit before they vote, request additional documentation like a pay stub or address, then have a cop detain you while they investigate to determine if you are who you say you are.

"I think the best bet for the Republicans is a guy like DeSantis, who Trump will publicly support but won't get the same extreme negativity because he's not Donald Trump. Regardless of whether conservatives like Trump or not - and he was uniquely popular - he was very divisive and so many Democrats hated him. I think he pushed plenty of people away who could be won over by a guy like DeSantis too.

So I don't think DeSantis will be as popular with Republicans as Trump was, but he has a better chance of convincing Democrats that they're on the wrong side, and of winning over any 'sometimes Republicans' who didn't like Trump. I don't think that section of people should be ignored either, the primary importance is to win elections.

Trump likely knows all this too. I think he knows that his support is better than his candidacy because then you're getting the best of both worlds; Trump's support will loyally back DeSantis, and those who hate Trump won't be able to cry about him endlessly.

"Whether DeSantis should or should not be a GOP front runner, it is clear he is a weasel and willing to provide material favors to his large campaign donors.

His talk with 60 minutes was a classical example of both sides of the conversation being misleading. To 60 min accusations of pay-for-play with Publix, DeSantis presented a narrative of him consulting with his staff, community leaders and but God Almighty Himself before deciding on selecting Publix. So no, 60 min does not have a clear-cut pay-for-play case, that is correct.

Yet, all but naïve children understand what that ""staff and community leaders"" consulting likely have been: he came, said something ""we all like Publix, riight?.."", and that was the end of it. So weaseling out of pay-for-play does not mean being oh so innocent and cool.

"Sure, let's keep the downvotes coming.

The last election wasn't ""Stolen"". Trump lost by 4 states. It would have been a blowout if the polls hadn't predicted him to lose by even more.

The Coronavirus is not being blown out of proportion by the msm to restrict people's freedoms. It was the third leading cause of death in the US last year. A quarter of a million Americans died from it.

No, the coronavirus numbers are not being ""fabricated"". There are inevitable errors in the data, but they probably aren't off by that much. 

Masks, while not great, are better than doing nothing.

No, Biden is not going senile. He has had a stutter for his entire life. 

Climate change is a real thing that is going to impact every person on the planet. Its not a hoax. The people who try hardest to perpetuate the idea that it is a hoax tend to be fossil fuel magnates.

Is this just referring to setting term limits on justices (potentially a good idea) or is there more to this? The article is very short and vaguely worded.

As it stands now for America, if you can walk here you're allowed in and you'll be processed when the already strained system can get to you. 

I'd be for allowing immigrants in, if they were cool with my ""Work to Earn"" program. Youd allow the govt to place you in jobs that may be low level but I also believe all parts of the workforce are important. Sometimes you need someone to do ""Charlie Work"" if I can reference Its Always Sunny. So while you are waiting to become legal US citizens you are already giving back to society compensated with shelter/food/secured living areas. Is it pretty? Probably not. Does it beat trying to cross the Rio? Yeah. Definitely would need refinement and talked at length to cover all aspects.

We are arguing over a statement that Biden made and whether it is factually correct or not. According to the law it is. A collector can sell guns at a gun show without requiring a background check, making the purchase 100% legal and involving no criminal activity. 

Just to tie this in. You say it barely happens. However Republicans are more than fine passing laws to stop in person voter fraud that statistics show us barely happen. So you guys are afraid of a boogeyman man that doesn’t exist (in person voter fraud) and so are liberals (no background checks for sales at gun shows).

Read the book I suggested.  You have NO idea what you are talking about. My grandparents lived under Socialism, and legally immigrated here to flee oppression.

 Right now, the Mexican cartels are threatening the Mexican police, telling them that if they don't do what they say, their families will be killed. The Beijing Biden regime is supporting this, supporting the rape of women, children, and even men. He has become the most prolific individual of murder and human trafficking there has ever been in the history of the United States.

 This is what communism looks like. Freely operating the government without the support of the people. Putting non-citizens before the legal citizens. NOT being able to leave your house due to a virus that has a 99.8% survival rate, wearing a cloth on your face that does nothing to stop the micro particles from penetrating...this is Control by the elites... the FIRST step in communism. Quit fooling yourself.

"This... Harvard Study... is an opinion based left wing source? 

Since 2017, we have been collecting data on political crowds in the United States, including the protests that surged during the summer. We have almost finished collecting data from May to June, having already documented 7,305 events in thousands of towns and cities in all 50 states and D.C., involving millions of attendees.
Because most of the missing data are from small towns and cities, we do not expect the overall proportions to change significantly once we complete the data collection.
We make two assumptions. First, when politicians and officials categorize the protests as violent, they are usually envisioning property destruction or interpersonal violence in which they infer that BLM protesters are attacking police, bystanders and property.
Second, using several measures to evaluate protest behavior offers a better assessment than the blanket term “violence.” For example, we disaggregate property destruction from interpersonal violence. We analyze separately the number of injuries or deaths among protesters and police. And we are thinking about how gathering even finer-grained data in the future could help further assign precise responsibility for violent acts.",1617985064.0,gty1t32,t1_gty1dwv,/r/Conservative/comments/mnjvwn/blm_cofounder_buys_1_million_dollar_home_near/gty1t32/,0.0,1617999464.0,"t1_gty1dwv, opinion, wing, source, data, crowds, protests, summer, events, thousands, towns, cities, states, millions, attendees, proportions, collection, assumptions, politicians, officials, property, destruction, violence, protesters, police, bystanders, measures, protest, behavior, assessment, blanket, term, example, number, injuries, deaths, gathering, future, responsibility, acts",0.35964912280701755,-0.003947368421052635,0.0
"So you say we have to power to choose, then use it to vote for leadership you believe in. Don’t just vote for the lesser of two evils, work with campaigns and representatives you believe in. You don’t have to vote for people who’s character you find flawed, and while everyone has their cracks you can vote for those with the smallest, the fewest, and with the most filled in from their attempts at bettering themselves. The only thing stopping the government from being what we want it to be is us. 

“it's always a choice and each individual has the power to choose.” This quote is a double-edged sword that all people should be willing to be cut by, but it is not a weapon you should allow people to swing with no regard for who might be sliced when they do. While every person has the right to choose whether or not they get the vaccine, it does not immunize them to criticism. The power of choice is one of the things that makes this country great and we should all be able to recognize that but there should be limits on choice. There are reasons people cannot be allowed to do anything and everything they desire, one of which is the way the effect others with those actions. These limits are the sheath in which we place the sword of choice. We must guide those who are naïve, as well as contain those who have malice in their hearts. 

The reason the FDA exists is due to people being willing to harm others. They did so by putting formaldehyde (most notably in milk marketed at children) and borax in their food products because it allowed them to stretch the product further in order to make more money.

"This is such bullshit. There is no good argument against auto-registration of 18 year olds. We can consider this once we know fraud occurs in large numbers instead of tiny instances.

Mail in voting also seems great to me and I still do not believe  the fraud story peddled by Trump. In 2020 the average line in ATL was over an hour where I lived and over 2-3 hours nearing the final days. Voting by mail works wonderfully in CO. It would allow urban areas that have 1 polling station per 100,000 people like some places in GA to vote at the same rate as rural areas that almost always have one polling station per 10,000 people.

"So you're suggesting throwing unaccompanied children out into the Mexican desert?

Deporting people the right way takes time and resources, and when the system gets overwhelmed you can end up with a backlog that's difficult to address. 

So when children come to the border, what can you do? You could turn them back around and let them fend for themselves in the desert (which is what the previous administration did) or you can hold them while you work on deporting them safely and correctly.

Granted, the second solution is far from perfect, as we are seeing the holding facilities become crowded and overwhelmed. *This* is the problem that the government requires assistance to solve. There are only so many beds to go around, so the only solutions would be to either let people loose, or find more beds.

The border is closed, except to those we grant asylum. People often conveniently forget that seeking asylum is legal, though I would also note that there is no guarantee an asylum request will be granted. Far from it, in fact. The vast majority of migrants who cross the border are deported, this hasn't changed. All that's changed is how we treat people in between their arrest and their eventual deportation.

"The source you posted just says people are moving away from the high rent San Francisco so you’re proving my point when I say that it has everything to do with high rent prices and nothing to do with “moving from the hell they created”

You’re argument falls apart when you recognize that high rent is not something a population controls. If you were right then we could blame Texas for creating a conditions for people to immigrate thus this is what Texans want...

My uncle just moved out there 2 months ago with a new house and cheap houses was literally the only reason. Nothing to do with politics it’s just the only reasonable way to get a house.

"Try reading the article. Also, Covid is absolutely just a flu. We have shut down the world for a slightly harsher common flu virus.

"&gt;My mistake, I was looking at yesterday’s cases and not 7 day.  Texas had 4,528 and I read that as the 7 day.  
&gt;
&gt;7 vs 11 is still a pretty substantial difference given how many people we are talking, but they are both much lower than many others.  Honestly I think the CA lockdown has been overblown.  I’m a HS teacher here and we have had uninterrupted in person hybrid learning in my district since October and everything but movie theatres and the like has been open for months.  Our county and city parks were closed on paper for months but everyone including the cops just ignored it.

Looking at a single day or even 7 days doesn't tell us a whole lot. Neither does your anecdotal experience in a single county within a massive state. But you are correct, not a single state locked down entirely, even entire cities didn't lock down entirely. Every comparison has to take that into account. 

California overall locked down more than Texas. And even then there are major demographic, political, geographical, climate and economic differences that could impact the differences in Covid cases. That's really the point. 

If someone can't prove that lockdowns and masks are effective relative to the damage they do, we shouldn't be creating blanket mandates or advocating for increased lockdowns across the country. 

What a bunch of pussies Americans have become, throwing away our rights and freedoms for potential marginal benefits on the fringes while our foreign enemies and competitors soldier on and take up ground we abandoned in the name of saving people who would likely have died sooner rather than later of a virus that 99.7% of the population will recover from. 

If it wasn't for all thr damn money we are spending I would say let the damn states do what they want. But we are forcing what I believe are their errors on everyone in this country even those not yet born. We are pissing away our nation's future and creating a road map for our enemies to weaken or destroy this county by simple allowing viruses to spread, we don't even need a hyper deadly virus, a slightly more deadly one could destroy us in the future because people allowed the government to lull us into compliance.",1617981691.0,gtxu333,t1_gtxq4ch,/r/Conservative/comments/mnh2kn/texas_keeps_covid_at_bay_after_scorn_for/gtxu333/,2.0,1617996091.0,"t1_gtxq4ch, mistake, yesterday, cases, day, gt, difference, people, others, lockdown, teacher, person, learning, district, movie, theatres, months, county, city, parks, paper, cops, days, lot, experience, state, cities, comparison, account, climate, differences, point, lockdowns, masks, damage, blanket, mandates, country, bunch, pussies, rights, freedoms, benefits, fringes, enemies, competitors, soldier, ground, name, virus, %, population, thr, money, states, errors, nation, future, road, map, viruses, government, compliance",0.37991452991452995,0.06958180708180704,1.0

"Here's a decent video that explains how it works, but I'll try to break it down too:
https://dmarcian.com/what-is-dkim/

DKIM does two things - it proves that an email originated from a *specific domain*, and it proves that the *body* of the email hasnt been tampered with.

A domain is the part of the email address that comes after the @ symbol. So if your email is dodgyasfuck@gmail.com, you know that the domain is GMail. We'll use that email as an example, so let's say you send an email to me from there. DKIM gets the body of the email and subset of the headers - what specifically is used depends on how it's implemented, there is variability in this - and generates a hash using the domains private key. The hash is included in the header of the email along with details on how it was computed (what algorithm was used, what domain it was sent from, *which header fields were included*, and a few other details). The receiver verifies the hash by using the signer's domain's public key (so the public key for gmail.com). What this does is validate that the *email originated from the gmail.com domain, and that the email was not changed after GMail 'signed' (with DKIM) the email and send it on it's way*. It does nothing to validate the identity of the person sending the email.

Whats the point of this? Let's say you work for a company that sends out internal emails. You get emails every day from yourboss@company.com, and you know it's from your boss because you know your the name of that person and it is prefixed with the company domain (@company.com).  Without a method like DKIM, someone can spoof an email from that email address, or intercept an email from your boss and modify it, before it gets to you, and the email server has no way to validate that it came from @company.com. DKIM uses the company private key to validate that it did indeed originate from @company.com, but you only know that that email belongs to your boss if you have previously already validated in some way that the email ACTUALLY belongs to him, because DKIM doesn't prove that the email address belongs to a specific person, it just confirms the domain from which the email was send.

This is my primary issue with the DKIM argument - I'm not arguing that Hunter is not a shitty person or doesn't deserves scrutiny, but this the details of this laptop story are *highly unusual* and this DKIM thing has been a point people have used to tie this all back to him. Most people don't actually know how DKIM works and won't take the time to understand it, so they just agree and move on. However, if you understand how and why it is used, you would understand why the argument doesn't work, and that's what I'm arguing here. Here's another good resource that helps explain it:

https://www.metaspike.com/leveraging-dkim-email-forensics/

I genuinely hope this helps; I'm not trying to argue a political point here, my background is in computer science and I'm just trying argue a neutral point about what this can or can't do.

"Correct. People say ""The platforms switched"" and while the parties did change overtime it isn't that simple. Before say..the 90s or 80s maybe? The political beliefs were far FAR more regional.

If you look at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEczkhfLwqM you can see that it was quite common back then to have Republicans that fit in perfectly with the Democrats and vice versa. So it's quite hard to say ""The parties switched!"" when it seems like what actually happened is that, while divergent views use to be accepted in both parties they now pretty much have to have a long checklist of party beliefs to be considered for federal office..so while you use to have liberal and conservatives members of both parties now there really is only Liberal Democrats and Conservative Republicans",1617980683.0,gtxrthy,t1_gtxpupc,/r/Conservative/comments/mn98z7/gov_abbott_says_its_time_to_make_texas_a_2nd/gtxrthy/,1.0,1617995083.0,"People, platforms, parties, overtime, 90s, 80s, beliefs, t1_gtxpupc, video, vice, views, checklist, party, office, conservatives, members",0.5307419432419432,0.12065446127946128,0.0

"&gt; So banning abortion and the right to make choices about your body and  the long term impacts of pregnancy is not controlling someones body 

Yes it is. It is the government creating laws to control someone else's body.

&gt; having to wear a mask to help stop the spread of a virus is controlling your body? 

Yes. If the government is going to make laws and/or mandates and force businesses or local police to be the henchmen to enforce them, that is the government controlling someone else's body.

The abortion debate has become very convoluted these days. The abortion situation should be handled by responsible parenting and proper birth control methods as much as possible.

"The nursing home scandal is a serious issue. The sexual harassment allegations that came in the heels of it haven’t yet been fully investigated. Meanwhile people are calling for his resignation when none of that has been substantiated.

Convenient timing that the moment he attempts to throw his staff under the bus for the nursing home cover up, they decide to accuse him of sexual impropriety. It sounds eerily familiar.

So no, I won’t call for his resignation or for his arrest until they prove he’s guilty. He probably should resign for the cover up, because that’s backed up by mountains of *evidence* and even admission on the record by his own staff. So that one is pretty tough to defend.

"Linking ""surge"" to ""insurgent"" is calling it like it was?? She tried and succeeded with her fans to discredit anyone who uses certain words to describe the obvious situation at the border...it IS a surge of immigrants data shows 174k vs same time last year of 30k? 

What IS the policy under the Biden admin? Do you even know? That's the problem from what I can tell its ""come in, we will send you some place in our country to wait for your application to be processed"" 

Two military bases are being used to house migrants, San Diego Convention center, Donna/Mission Texas border facilities at max capacity. When Trump was in, did they have to use military bases to house the influx? Nope. Not even 6 months into Bidens admin and look how crazy it's become. 

My noise would be to stop ALL immigration no matter the reason. You can come to our border but you cant get in until we fix our in house shit first. I'd work with Mexico to build housing along the border as waiting stations. The people would have to work to maintain the structures as their payment. I'm sure some migrants have basic construction knowledge so could be used to help build and stay on as temp maintenance until processed into the USA.

"You either completely ignore or fail to see my point. 

“Interesting that there is never any found outside of a case or two. The GOP has been hell vent at finding it and never can.”

I clearly explained how it would be nearly impossible to discover fraudulent voters without voter ID requirements. 

Let’s play out a hypothetical. A poll worker in CA witnesses a person cast a vote without presenting ID, they just signed an affidavit affirming that they are that person (“Eligible Voter”). The poll worker wishes to challenge the ballot and the eligibility of the person that just cast it. 

How would they do that if the only info the person provided is an affidavit with a fraudulent signature on it? Without the real Eligible Voter showing up to vote, there would be no way to determine that the vote was fraudulent. 

I really don’t understand why people are opposed to voter ID laws. I do not know a single adult that doesn’t have a govt issued ID.

"You’ve been very clear that you believe all of these things are privileges. 

Let me get to my point now: it is not a majority opinion on “the left” (a group I’m technically in, conservative upbringing notwithstanding) that “this is a right”. 

I’m a lot more pragmatic about this: right now, all I care about is that affordable, accessible healthcare that won’t bankrupt you **is just a good idea, period**. 

Taking a few steps back, most would argue that maintaining roads, infrastructure, fire/police departments and other public services is a good idea. Privilege or not, these are things that are required in a modern society. Did they always exist? No. Does that mean they should not exist? Also no. These services are the result of progress. 

I see healthcare the same way. Setting the question of rights aside (hell, let’s say for sake of argument that it’s not a right at all), we should still implement a healthcare system that addresses the issues I mentioned above just based on the merits of such a system. 

Now, let’s talk about some unalienable rights: 

&gt;	We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are *Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness*.

It is the role of government to preserve and protect these rights. Many public services can be mapped to these rights - the services themselves may be a privilege, but they exist in support of these foundational principles. 

In many folks’ view, healthcare falls under the “Life” category. Is healthcare a right? I don’t know. But does healthcare help preserve my right to maintain life? I would argue yes. 

This debate does not solely rise and fall on the “right to healthcare”, but on the expectations of a modern society, and a recognition that the cost of inaction (poor health, financial ruin, death) directly threaten the few rights deemed unalienable by our forefathers. 

Hopefully this helps clarify my position.

"He *is* charged with manslaughter. He's charged with three different levels of ""murder,"" which vary based on intent level. Manslaughter is the least of those charges.

But you're right that the intent is a key element in this case. I don't think they can prove that he intentionally killed Floyd (which is the highest charge), but IMO they can show he acted with disregard to Floyd's life. I can't speak to the specifics of Minnesota law, but the states are similar in how they treat the different levels of intent.

So, in essence, I agree the highest charge is overreach, but the lowest charge is very feasible IMO.

This is silly and wrong 

&gt;Would you be alright with it if the US increased legal immigration by 300,000 per year. People just have to show up at a legal border entry, have a background check and health check and they're allowed in?

Does 300k help the US? Should it be more? Or less? I'd like to have this researched by our govt. Also, who ever comes needs to be vetted. We also need to give a fair chance to those all around the world and it should be based on skill. We don't need to have 300k low skill, poorer individuals, as we have plenty already in this country and should focus our resources on them.

&gt;Also, perhaps you assumed I was saying our border was like the Eurozone, but I was instead saying what is the argument for our border to not be like the Eurozone?

America is by FAR among the LEAST racist countries on Earth, ever. We have progressed so far in 200 years, and under Obama, Democrat hegemony, and this post-Civil Rights model era, we are just now regressing (dividing by race, seeing only race, building up racism against whites).

You seem to think our rejection of neo-racism, our rejection of Democrat false history, our rejection of Democrat lieing accounting of our standing, is denying that some relatively small degree of racism exists.

It's not.

We all know some still exists.

But we also can see how much we've progressed, and how we're light years ahead of most of the World.

I am saying that states without voter ID laws are ripe for fraud. Govt issued ID’s are significantly harder to fake than a pay stub or a utility bill.

Pay stubs and utility bills don’t have either of these. 

Regarding your other point about punishment for casting a fake ballot, how would you catch a person that fraudulently signed an affidavit swearing they’re Eligible Voter A if they’re not actually that person? If they didn’t provide any identifying info, they just signed a fraudulent affidavit, cast their vote, and they’re on their way.

"A USA today article by Christine Stapelton said ""DeSantis said the CDC's order was not preventing people from cruising, but instead only putting Florida and U.S. ports at a competitive disadvantage as cruise lines move ships to other parts of the world.""

I only share this excerpt because this article makes it look as though cruises are still banned and they are not. There are still restrictions but let's not forget the 800 people who were stuck on a cruise ship for 2 months last year and our daily 8000 covid case count.

Wouldn't ships be moving to other parts of the world because he put a ban on vaccine passports here in Florida?  Wouldn't it be easier and more profitable for the cruise lines and the state if he amended or lifted his vaccine passport ban?  Is this not a problem he created which he is now being the hero to solve?

  Some money and some cruises &gt; no money and no cruises. 

This is where I am confused why conservatives are okay with this.  Proceeding with caution and maintain our rights while earning precious tax dollars for big business and the state would be a conservative thing to do.  Suing the federal government and putting restrictions on the free market would be a waste of money.

"I’m not certain about this assessment and here’s why. First let me say Tobin is a world renowned pulmonologist and written what’s considered sentinel articles on lung function...but he is not a toxicologist nor an ED doc, but his knowledge and experience is vast. Now with that out of the way.
I’m a bit perplexed by the notion that his resp rate of 21 bpm that he proposes is NOT c/w fentanyl. Yes fentanyl causes resp depression. However, if you also have a person resisting arrest (whatever that means in this context), utilizing other methamphetamines”, and/or develops pulmonary edema (known complication of fentanyl overdoses with several proposed mechanisms) then most certainly you won’t have respiratory depression. Most people when they’re SOA/SOB increase their respiratory rate, the vast majority! The drive to breathe is immense. Only fentanyl blunts that drive so it looks “normal”.

Yeah but the way I look at stuff like this when it comes to giving people things is is there an economic or societal upside? In this case I think there is both.

The average conservative just wants to be left alone to live their life in peace, the average leftist (because I genuinely believe that the farther ""left"" has become its own mainstream and most ""liberals"" are more centrist now) believes that they must tell conservatives **how** to live because they think conservatives are stupid, uneducated, and wrong, in their minds that is the only reason anyone could ever be a conservative.

That is the crux of my argument, one side just wants to be left alone by and large, the other side refuses to do so because they see themselves as the arbiters of all that is good and right, and many people are simply caught in the middle because they don't really like either ""side""

I recognize that conservative politicians are just that, politicians, they tend to ""pour it on"" a little thicker than your average conservative citizen, and the truly ""far"" right have some serious issues I completely understand that.

"I’m all for voter ID. It’s absurd that it’s not required everywhere- BUT, constitutionally, I believe they should only be required if they’re mandatory.  If everybody MUST have an id that the government enforces possession of, I’m all for it. 

US is only country in the world where a personal ID of some sort is not required, and one of the reasons there’s such a problem with finding illegals. Since nobody NEEDS to have an ID, potentially everybody/anybody  without one COULD be a citizen. Anyplace else in the world it’s “let me see your papers please”.  
My qualm with this law, and also the Georgia law isn’t that they require ID, I’m all for that as I say.  My problem with it is that the laws don’t simultaneously legislate that the state must provide the id-  saying “well, anybody is welcome to come and get one” isn’t enough, because everybody knows that there’s a certain demographic who are reluctant to “come and get one”.   Look at all the comments here joking about how “oh Wyoming is racist”.  Well- if you look at them objectively, precisely because the required IDs are voluntary instead of mandatory and minority communities are 1) more distrusting of government - ironically - than r/conservative is and 2) because, by chance, there are fewer places in their districts to acquire those IDs, yes they’re racist laws.

"I guess it depends on your interpretation. To me, individualism is just like it sounds. It stresses independence, self reliance and the will of the individual over the will of the collective. 

That’s not to say I think we should function in a world where it’s every man for themself and no one should help anyone out. I’m not naive. No one gets through their entire life without the help of someone else.

I have no problem helping out those that need help. . . . It’s the *mechanism* by which the help is distributed is the problem I have. If a person needs help, there are many avenues they can pursue. Family is a great place to start. Community is another route. Ask your neighbors, ask your friends, your church, etc. . . Charities are another great place to seek help. 

The government picking and choosing those *they* deem worthy of help. . . . Especially in this case, because it’s based solely on skin color or ethnicity. . . . This doesn’t even boil down to wanting to help the poor. . . It’s helping *a certain kind of poor*. That’s where I draw the line. . . Especially when it is reliant on tax dollars. 

We pay taxes on goods and services for things *we all* get to utilize. Roads, schools, police and fire, etc. I’d have no problem with this program if it were funds that were privately donated. If a person wants to utilize their own money to pushing this cause. . . I have no say in how someone else chooses to utilize their money.

CBS is saying that De Santis is cherry picking data to make it look like it was simply a data driven choice.

"I’m pretty sure rifles account for 3% of gun deaths each year. 

I don’t mean to sound like a conspiracy theorist but if I wanted to take a countries guns away this is basically exactly how I would do it. 

Showing the ‘bad military guns’ that are responsible for mass shootings to get people who don’t own guns on your side to ban them is a good strategy. 

Once any real laws are passed though, it will apply to all guns. He might be an old, creepy asshat but some of what he said is alarming to me. 

Also some of what he said is outright misleading. Telling how black and urban communities are impacted the most by gun violence without telling the rest of the truth, that the majority of that violence is dealt with handguns and by other people of color is deceptive as hell. 

He also lied about the ‘red flag’ laws too. Speaking on domestic violence and how women are being murdered as a reason to expand those laws to a federal level is another misleading statement on his behalf. The Lautenburg Amendment already exists, and to my knowledge makes a domestic violence related misdemeanor the only misdemeanor that can have your right to bear revoked.

"Childish insults don't work here. They don't make you look smarter, trust me.

You have not explained why Crowder's reenactment of the situation was invalid nor why aren't the prosecutors clamoring to perform their own. A doctor who testified lied on the witness stand that a healthy person in the position that Floyd was in would have tied as well, which is clearly not the case. Thousands of similar arrests are made everyday and suspects don't die unless there are other factors (like lethal levels of drugs in the blood) involved. 

Another doctor who testified previously, initially claimed that Floyd died due to asphyxia caused by law enforcement restraint. Then he changed the story when cross examined by the defense and said that asphyxia is also the result of Fentanyl overdose. He couldn't point to what the actual cause was because he didn't know.

The problem here is that you didn't know about any of this. Defense cross examinations where the expert witnesses have to concede that everything they claimed previously was just wild conjecture, saying things that they were expected to be said so as not to expose their persons to an angry mob that is sure to go after them.

"First off, it doesn't make it harder for legal citizens to vote.  If you are dead, how is it harder for you to vote if you were taken off the voter roll?  Secondly, I can't say what the probability is or isn't.  Not many people can except those who deal with voter fraud everyday.

What I can say is that here is a scenario that relates to something that very much already happens to people:  they get something in the mail with their name and address on it, or something that has more information about them and they throw it in the garbage.  Someone comes along and snoops through trash and finds these people to steal their identity.  Identity theft is a big problem and is mostly done by looking through garbage.  That is why you are supposed to shred sensitive information.  

Even most companies have a crew come in and securely haul out shredded material so that the company's secrets and sensitive information don't get found out by garbage snoopers.  With that, what do you think most people are going to do when they get a mail-in ballot for someone that isn't them?  They will probably throw it in the garbage.  In fact, during the last election there were many reports of mail-in ballots found in garbage and such.

Is it a high probability that it happens?  I think there is a good chance that what I just described already happens.  How does it effect elections and does it matter?  I think it could considering some elections can get down to 1% difference or less between two candidates.  That literally just happened in Georgia.

Let me ask you something: why wouldn't you think it is a good idea to remove someone from a voter roll when they can't vote by any means?  Whether they be dead or some other reason that they legally or impossible to vote?  Why is that an actual problem?",1617948166.0,gtwh6hy,t1_gtweglr,/r/Conservative/comments/mmcrbo/lawsuit_forces_pennsylvania_to_take_21000_dead/gtwh6hy/,1.0,1617962566.0,"citizens, voter, roll, probability, people, fraud, everyday, scenario, mail, name, address, information, garbage, trash, identity, Identity, theft, problem, companies, crew, material, company, secrets, snoopers, ballot, fact, election, reports, ballots, chance, elections, %, difference, candidates, t1_gtweglr, idea, means, reason",0.4079501915708812,0.11055555555555557,0.0

From what I can tell, Crowder and his crew did a decent job. He was handcuffed on the pavement with someone kneeling on his back and neck in a posture as similar to Chauvin's as possible. This person was probably larger than Chauvin, who weighs only 140lbs, but Chauvin's police equipment (30-40lbs) probably negated the difference.

"Legitimate Marxists (and other communists, for that matter) are not part of Biden's base. If they voted at all, rather than abstaining from having to select a leader who does not represent a single of their ideals, they would have voted for Biden with one hand while holding their noses with the other. 

Marxism is at its core a noble, if tremendously naïve, ideology. As such, true Marxists are populists who would hate Biden's expansion of the federal government.

Biden's true base consists of socialists and other totalitarians who get off at the thought of the government stomping the people into submission. Every time Biden said the word ""unity,"" or talked about working together, there was a hidden asterisk at the end. See, Democrat ""unity"" is the same concept referred to when historians talk about an ancient general ""uniting"" a nation. It involves everyone ""uniting"" under their banner or being silenced and disenfranchised. This ideal is not only held by those Democrats in office, but by their most outspoken supporters as well, who will loudly proclaim their desire to negotiate, only to then not give a single inch, while complaining that their opposition has not given a full mile.

People on this sub complain all the time about weak Republican leadership, but often times that weakness is simply a willingness to compromise that the Democrats completely lack. Since such a willingness is not found among Democrats, it appears as though Republicans constantly make needless concessions, when in reality those compromises only happen to avoid media slander, to which the Democrats have the privilege of immunity.",1617947181.0,gtwfz0f,t1_gtwe1ds,/r/Conservative/comments/mn9zuh/biden_repeatedly_bungles_atf_title_while/gtwfz0f/,1.0,1617961581.0,"t1_gtwe1ds, communists, matter, part, base, leader, single, ideals, hand, noses, core, ideology, Marxists, populists, expansion, government, socialists, totalitarians, thought, people, submission, time, word, unity, asterisk, end, concept, historians, nation, banner, ideal, office, supporters, desire, inch, opposition, mile, People, sub, leadership, times, weakness, willingness, concessions, reality, compromises, media, slander, privilege, immunity",0.6268062397372742,-0.011247947454844013,0.0

"First, nobody has 'shown' anything. A lot of claims have been made but no solid evidence of anything has been posted anywhere.

Second, DKIM is a method used to prove that a message was authorized and sent by a domain owner and received without being tampered with, and I believe in this case that owner is Google (GMail services yes? supposedly Mr. Hunter was using some gmail address). So DKIM just says that an @gmail.com address sent a message and it was not changed in any way. *DKIM does not give identification of the sender or receiver in any way*, just that the message being relayed from A to B has not been tampered with.

So sure, Bobulinsky sent and received emails, and the message of the mail wsren't tampered with between the the time they were sent and the time they arrived in his inbox. So what?

"&gt;The American rescue plan had some good stuff, but there was just so much useless spending.

I'm still hunting for my sources, but it is my understanding that the real economic danger right now is not doing enough, as opposed to doing too much. Wasn't there a delayed recovery from the Great Recession for this very reason?

&gt;Also, if you think that plan will be a major accomplishment, your fooling yourself: it had no republicans support, it will not cut child poverty in half, and will lessen the value of the dollar.

This legislation will be the crowning achievement for many congresspeoples' careers. It's an unprecedented stimulus. Columbia University's Center on Poverty and Social Policy may have relied on the assumption of the minimum wage increase being a part of their projection (which did not make it). Still, I don't think it invalidates the study in an integral way. Even if it's not a 57.8% decrease in child poverty, it will lead to good outcomes for a fuckload of people. As far as inflation, I don't believe we've seen that in a significant way as of now, even after trillions spent in previous stimulus money.

&gt;He’s not handling immigration well at all, to the point where his administration has no transparency on the issue.

Lol Jen Psaki may not be trumpeting it from the rooftops, but television crews have been let into the camps/jails/cages/what have you. I've seen kids playing soccer and having toys and stuff. Maybe it's all a big conspiracy and we can't believe anything again ever, but it does seem like a good sign.

&gt;Also, you say republicans are obstructing, which is in a way true: they are obstructing far left legislation that they vehemently opposed. The bills getting passed by democrats are so left that they can’t even draw support from moderates republicans and have waning support from moderate democrats.

It is absolutely true. They are obstructing everything. Progressives are a significant faction in the Democratic Party, and their bills will represent that more and more. Democrats cannot abandon progressives at this point and splinter their party (even more than it already is), and Republicans have been blocking almost every Democratic bill since Obama's 2nd year. Why should we alienate progressives any more than we already have? You wouldn't help us regardless. Progressives would laugh if you called Obama far left. As far as moderate democrats, they tend to change with the party. They may blur the line between right and left at times, but they are still democrats.

"China was losing very badly against Japan, taking mass casualties without doing proportional damage to the Japanese. They would not have won without American intervention. Capturing islands wasn't the decisive part of the Pacific War. It was US naval supremacy and the destruction of the Japanese nautical trade network that prevented them from importing material from their colonies that led to their defeat. The islands were just convenient little pieces of land along that trade network. The nuclear bombs also helped convince their leadership that they had lost. 

A large portion of German oil did come from Romania, but a lot of it also came from synthetic fuel plants in Germany. Also oil needs a lot of refinement to create fuel usable in war machines, and the USAAF targeted refineries in Germany, in addition to the synthetic fuel plants to great effect.

I'm glad we can agree that lend-lease and other material aid was impactful.

The city council (all left leaning morons) have instituted a city wide mask mandate for all businesses, no exception.  Signs in store windows that tell us to wear a mask to keep the city open (makes me feel like I'm back in elementary school, like a threat that if we don't blindly follow this damn rule they will take our rights and freedoms away), and this shit is going to last here until the end of June, when the city will vote on it again.  So while I can drive 15 minutes to another city and shop without a mask, I can't do so here in my town unless I have a fucking mask.  And if a business forgoes the mask mandate?  The gutless college students who blindly support this mandate, will call the city and complain.  These are the same ones who complain when people had friends over at their place a year ago and called us Nazis for telling them to butt out of other people's affairs.

&gt; You're the one insinuating that the State of Florida intends to sue 60 minutes 

While I said, 

&gt; You cannot defame the government 

even challenged the comment I responded to that it isn't possible for state to sue for defamation by saying this, 

&gt; Tell you what you find me just one lawsuit that the government filed aka state of florida or united states vs a person/company for DEFAMATION and I will delete this account. 

Since I can't post crayon drawings I will write it in bold letters and hope that you can get the last 2 brain cells together and comprehend ""**THE STATE CANNOT SUE FOR DEFAMATION""**   


&gt; which was never stated by anyone here or by DeSantis himself. 

If he didn't mean that he intends to sue 60 minutes for defamation then the alternative interpretation of his comments would be that he plans on using the power of the state to go after them in any way he deems necessary. Unless in your reality, your interpretation is that he just meant he wants to cuddle them this clearly shouldn't be the path you want to go on.   


&gt; He used his platform to announce that WE would fight back, as in HIM and his conservative backing. 

So did he explicitly say this and what is the interpretation of his conservative backing fight? What kind of consequences do you expect here if it isn't a defamation lawsuit since conservative backers cannot sue 60 minutes and only person that has standing is Ron himself.   


&gt; Yes it is a high bar but it is still absolutely worth pursuing. 

I never said he shouldn't? I take objection of him saying this in his capacity as governor not him as a person. Again, re-read my comments it will click eventually.

"""Today, Rochelle P. Walensky MD, MPH, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), declared racism a serious public health threat.""

""What we know is this: racism is a serious public health threat that directly affects the well-being of millions of Americans. As a result, it affects the health of our entire nation. Racism is not just the discrimination against one group based on the color of their skin or their race or ethnicity, but the structural barriers that impact racial and ethnic groups differently to influence where a person lives, where they work, where their children play, and where they worship and gather in community.

Texas is changing politically because it has cheap housing and lower rent/taxes. Blaming california for migration and political realignment is like blaming a drought for a forest fire. It’s all nature baby!!

Texas politics WILL change because it’s becoming more metropolitan and urbanized. Like I said your values are created by your environment and having few neighbors to interact with tends to limit ones life experiences leading to conservative values the opposite happens for densely populated areas

And “C” there is some truth to it. But given the situation and how intense it was it isnt surprising they kept him restrained an additional few minutes. Sounds like a policing mistake... not murder.

&gt;The quote, however, does not appear in the *Enciclopedia Italiana* in the original Italian.  
&gt;  
&gt;It does  not  appear in the official English translation of that article:  
&gt;  
&gt;Benito Mussolini, 1935, ""The Doctrine of Fascism,"" Firenze: Vallecchi Editore.  
&gt;  
&gt;And it does not appear in the longer treatment of the subject by Mussolini         in:  
&gt;  
&gt;Benito Mussolini, 1935, ""Fascism: Doctrine and Institutions,"" Rome:  'Ardita' Publishers.   
&gt;  
&gt;Where the quote comes from remains a mystery, and while it is possible           Mussolini said it someplace at some time, a number of researchers have           been unable to find it after months of research.

From the very article you linked.  


As for the second article those kinds of arguments are so easily applied to either side.  Watch I just need to replace a few words or give different examples.   


&gt; First, racial division was a central component of Nazi political strategy   
 The  Democrat party and the left, using the so-called mainstream media, is  doing the same among their manufactured identity groups (as defined by  race or sexual orientation or ethnicity) in order to foment anger and  isolate a specific group: white, heterosexual Christians. 

Instead of the ""Democrat party and the left,""  It is ""Republican and the right""   
instead of ""white heterosexual Christians"" it is ""the left""  


&gt;Second,  the Nazi Party was fixated on censorship and eliminating any cultural  institution, publication or speech that did not fully support them. 

This subreddit, or in an extreme case the parler app.  


&gt; Third, the Nazis perfected the art of indoctrinating the citizenry through propaganda and “fake news.” 

Former president Trump told so lies about election fraud months before the election over and over again.  While Fox News (""Attack on Christmas"" ""censoring Dr Seuss"") and social media have become echo chambers.  Creating a radicalized right.  


&gt; Fourth,  the Nazis, true to socialist ideology, preyed on class envy to stoke  tensions and resentment as they blamed the “Junker Class” 

Can't let the poor people get money with a minimum wage raise or else the economy will come crashing down.    


&gt; Fifth,  in the 1920’s and early 30’s the Nazi Party routinely relied on street  riots, property damage and gratuitous violence utilizing their militant  cadre, the Sturmabteilung (SA), to project power through intimidation  while blaming the communists for the violence.  

January 6th capitol riot, blame antifa  


&gt; Sixth, in  January 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany.  Within four  weeks a mysterious fire broke out in the Reichstag (Congress) Building  which they blamed on communist agitators and that this was the opening  salvo in a violent coup 

Again January 6th capitol riot

&gt;Once a critical mass of people have it, the virus has no where else to grow and evolve.

You're only partially correct about the flu. Influenza has been a part of the human eco system for millions of years. There are already thousands and thousands of strains. The updated flu vaccine just takes on the ones that appear to be the most prevalent the year before. They are necessarily new strains.

On top of that, because influenza has so many strains, and has been familiar with the human body for so long, it evolves far more efficiently than where COVID is currently at.

In 1994, she took a six-month leave of absence from her Alameda County job to join the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. Brown then appointed her to the California Medical Assistance Commission, where she served until 1998, attending two meetings a month for a $99,000 annual salary.

&gt;“These jobs were created before I was born,” Harris says. “Whether you agree or disagree with the system, I did the work.

"Let's talk about this. You seem to imagine that doctors are only there to fix problems. That's what we get paid for a lot of the time. But doctors also can help healthy people. For example, you will agree kids need to be educated and for that we send them to school. But healthy kids can fall sick in school so we anticipate it and take this pointy thing and poke them in the skin and leave stuff in their healthy muscles that the body uses to protect against harmful diseases.   
By your logic DO NOT poke healthy kids and make them cry or bleed or feel pain or discomfort or fall sick for a day or two in order to protect them from something worse.   
From an ethics standpoint, we can't wait until they grow up and can decide to immunize themselves. We obtain informed consent from the people who have legal rights to make those decisions for them viz. Their parents. Is there a risk that a healthy child will have a reaction to the injection? Yes. Do the risks outweigh the benefits? Yes. Do the parents provide informed consent? Yes. We proceed. Any of these are a no? We wait and reevaluate. Makes sense?

I love how I've still got you hooked and reaching so far for some ammunition to use here.

Wrong. I couldn't have helped her without quitting my job and moving hundreds of miles to be here for her during the pandemic. Do I have to hold your hand again and repeat why she asked me specifically?

Wrong. At no point did I say that this was any kind of ""real job"" nor did I argue that it requires any kind of special skills.
Although, as much as you may mock the occupation, it is a necessary job that helps alot of people who would be helpless without their IHSS service providers.

Wrong. The amount of money that I was making before had nothing to do with my decision to take on this responsibility.
Can you hear yourself 😂 do you just not care about how stupid you sound now 😂 just as long as you can make an argument of any kind?
I can hold your hand again and walk you through it, boy.
My mother is high risk. She didn't want anyone she couldn't absolutely trust to quarantine and socially distance to enter her premises and out her at risk. She asked me if I would be willing to help. I agreed. My decision had nothing to do with money.

"The problem is these are called illegal immigrants when the majority are in reality refugees. The conditions in their home countries are driving them out. Even if we had a 1000’ wall the country to our south would suffer and we have a partnership with Mexico for food(especially seasonally in the winters that we depend on) for manufacturing, tourism etc. We need stability in North, Central and South America. 

We can’t save the world and we need to have our house in order to be effective stewards of what we have here in the US. That means encouraging Republicans and Democrats to hold their parties accountable for productive policies and laws regarding border security, immigration and asylum. 

Let’s build a wall where possible, provide the border patrol with tools they need to do their job, and stop the flow at it’s source.

Illegal immigration policies are not effective as is. It is magnified by the unaccompanied minors due to the current policy that is placing 80% of them with family already here.

"Like you, I have concerns about our elections.  More so over the past several years.

Regarding mail in ballots, to which states are you referring, and how does that impact mail in ballots differently than in person voting, so that it would lead to a different outcome?

Prior to any vote being counted, the mail in voter signatures are compared to what is on file. The list of voters us the same for mail in votes as for in person votes at the polling locations.

Why would you see one as a problem and not the other?

Regarding perception - it truly is important.  Perception is also something that can be manipulated. There was a very purposeful manipulation by the previous administration to cast doubt on the validity of mail in votes.  Unfortunately, it was incredibly effective at convincing a large number of US citizens to believe , despite the lack of evidence, including dozens of court findings, that the election was actually won by Trump.

When you weigh the hard evidence there is no justification that mail in voting should be any more distrusted than in person voting.

The vast majority of people who were concerned with mail in voting, were people who were told that the media is nothing but fake news, that the election was being stolen, and that the only true source was Trump.

"Well it is complicated. Trump stopped allowing asylum seekers in, which caused a backlog of people trying to get in. Biden is accepting them again as it was always our policy to accept asylum seekers and the surge of backlogged immigrants was expected. So technically if we were always going to accept asylum seekers this would be mostly trumps fault, but there is more to the story...

I don’t think we should allow many asylum seekers as 70% of the migrants are not even from mexico, but instead travelled through it and were even guided to our border by Mexico’s government because they don’t want them either. If we would have kept barring asylum seekers then Mexico would begin to deal with the problem they push off to us. Trump created the situation, but of Biden would have held out we may have made some real progress once central and South Americans understood they were not going to get in and simply stopped making the trek through Mexico. Stay in one of the other countries you travelled through instead of trying to force your way into this one, settling in the Southwest, and over supplying labor(which allows shitty companies to let the lower class fight for the scraps of low wages).

"Sure, if it makes you start pointing fingers at the Biden administration...

Although, the numbers were way lower during Trump's administration. In fact, we don't even know the numbers for Biden, because he is restricting the media. A media that already panders to the Democrats. Makes you wonder how bad it is really getting. 

Most of the children that were separated during Trump's administration, were because you can't have children in a cell with dangerous criminals. I would want Biden to separate children from dangerous criminals as well though.

The kids in cages during Trump's administration was an overblown exaggeration. It just became a catchy slogan that Democrat supporters grabbed on to. His numbers were not that far off from Obama's or Bush's. His peaked a little bit higher when he was, for a short period of time, treating every illegal like they were dangerous criminals. He received pushback from his base, and he eased up on that tactic.

"People can buy guns from one state and bring them to another. That’s why we need nationwide laws. 

I’m surprised you’re arguing that the deaths of 11k people aren’t worth addressing. Interesting position to take. But your data is off. There were 20k deaths by gun violence 2020. Plus another 24k suicides by gun. That’s a huge number of families, friend groups, neighbors, employers, etc affected by just gun deaths, not even all those affected by gun violence. 

And no, there are not more homicides by hammers than guns. I assume you got that from similar tweets going around re: deaths by AR-15 vs the “other weapon” category in CA which includes all manner of items used as weapons beyond rifles, handguns, knives/blades, other types of firearms and hands/feet/body. The blunt object category, which includes but is not limited to hammers, is responsible for more deaths that riffles and shotguns INDIVIDUALLY. But all firearms as a group far exceed any other category of weapon in terms of numbers of death caused. So no, your assertion is not accurate per the data.

No doubt there are numerous causes of violence including gun violence. But that does not negate the experiences of those countries that have moved to restrict gun ownership; the data is clear — restricting gun ownership among a country’s general population dramatically reduces the rates of gun violence.",1617924546.0,gtvctra,t1_gtsu7cn,/r/Conservative/comments/mmgr5i/biden_will_announce_six_executive_actions_to/gtvctra/,1.0,1617938946.0,"People, guns, state, laws, deaths, 11k, people, position, data, 20k, gun, violence, 24k, number, families, friend, groups, neighbors, employers, homicides, hammers, tweets, t1_gtsu7cn, weapon, category, manner, items, weapons, rifles, handguns, knives, blades, types, firearms, hands, feet, body, object, shotguns, group, terms, numbers, death, assertion, doubt, causes, experiences, countries, ownership, country, population, rates",0.5019179894179895,0.08115079365079367,0.0

"The media has reveled this year in the frequent, gleeful penning of obituaries for the Republican Party. The GOP is described as broken, fractured, befuddled about its identity, dying or already dead, not to mention up an unprintable creek, after corporate donors cut money following the Jan. 6 riot.

Or maybe not.

The obits are hard to square with a surprising new number from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s political team: $27.1 million. That’s the amount they tell me Mr. McCarthy single-handedly raked in during the first quarter of 2021. It’s the most money any Republican representative has ever raised in a quarter. 

It’s even more notable given it was accomplished mostly in two months: January was rough for Republicans. And it was done almost entirely without big-business support. Only about $450,000, or less than 2%, came from corporate political-action committees. How big is a $27.1 million quarter? Mr. McCarthy raised about $100 million over the entire previous two-year cycle, or an average of $12.5 million a quarter.

The National Republican Congressional Committee announced on Thursday that it raked in $33.7 million in the first quarter (about $5 million of which came from Mr. McCarthy). It pulled in $19.1 million in March alone—an odd-year fundraising record. And the National Republican Senatorial Committee, under Florida Sen. Rick Scott, had one of its healthiest Februarys in years, bringing in $6.4 million—despite a precipitous drop in corporate PAC donations. (It has yet to report quarterly numbers.)

The numbers are even more striking because they shouldn’t be. Republican voters remain demoralized over losing the presidency, and some are furious that more GOP lawmakers didn’t dispute the results. The party has yet to figure out how it will manage Donald Trump, and the potential for damaging clashes with the former president—over recruitment, primaries and issues—remains high. The Democrat-media complex is working hard to brand the party as racist, insurrectionist and toxic for suburban or minority voters to support. And Democrats crushed Republicans in fundraising last year.

So what gives? Here’s what the obits are missing: Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Nothing unifies the Republican Party more than the threat of an all-Democrat, progressives-gone-wild Washington. GOP fundraisers tell me their pitch to donors the past two months has been as simple as it has been effective: The only way to stop the left’s radical transformation of the country is to retake the House and Senate. That objective is bringing Republicans together and opening pocketbooks—and the more Mr. Biden pushes left, the bigger and more the checks. The unity is forming much faster than it did in 2009, the last time the Democrats took the presidency and both congressional chambers.

The fundraising also highlights the widening split between the GOP and corporate America and the risks to business of losing clout with its traditional free-market defenders. Media outlets crowed when dozens of corporations announced in January that their PACs would “pause” donations to the GOP in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot. “Republicans’ Corporate Money Problem Is Getting Worse by the Day,” exulted HuffPost in January, one of dozens of pieces predicting doom for a party said to rely on business dollars.

The reality is that corporate PAC money has faded in significance over the years, and the GOP message with this fundraising blowout is that Republicans can get by without it, thank you very much. Mr. McCarthy raised his $27.1 million from more than 50,000 unique donors, with average amounts less than $540. (By comparison, in the first quarter of 2019, he raised $22 million from about 6,000 donors.) The NRSC reports that half of its February money came from online contributions, and that it has seen a surge in small-dollar donors.

If anything, GOP fundraisers report that corporate America’s politicking is helping the party’s bank accounts. Many Americans are furious over the likes of Delta and Coca-Cola wading into the Georgia election-law fight, and a growing anticorporate wing of the party is donating to Republicans to make a point—and to encourage the GOP to make a break. This is potentially dangerous territory both for companies and the economy, and it may explain why some firms are now quietly “unpausing” donations, seeking to repair ties with Republicans.

Money isn’t a direct proxy for political support, and dollars alone don’t win elections, as Hillary Clinton proved in 2016. Republicans have tricky territory to navigate in coming years, from recruiting worthy replacements for many retiring incumbents to managing real divides in the base. Democratic contenders for key Senate races are already pulling in bucks. 

But the GOP fundraising numbers show that reports of the party’s death are greatly exaggerated. The best tonic for restoring the Republican Party’s health is an overreaching Democratic White House and Congress.",1617923473.0,gtvapjg,t3_mn3zjw,/r/Conservative/comments/mn3zjw/the_best_tonic_for_restoring_the_gop_overreaching/gtvapjg/,3.0,1617937873.0,"media, year, penning, obituaries, t3_mn3zjw, identity, creek, donors, money, riot, obits, number, team, amount, quarter, representative, months, business, support, %, action, committees, cycle, average, fundraising, record, years, drop, donations, numbers, voters, presidency, lawmakers, results, party, potential, clashes, president, recruitment, primaries, issues, complex, minority, threat, progressives, fundraisers, pitch, way, transformation, country, objective, opening, pocketbooks, pushes, checks, unity, time, chambers, split, risks, clout, market, defenders, Media, outlets, dozens, corporations, PACs, wake, Money, Day, pieces, doom, dollars, reality, significance, message, blowout, amounts, comparison, half, contributions, surge, dollar, politicking, bank, accounts, likes, election, law, fight, wing, point, break, territory, companies, economy, firms, ties, proxy, elections, Republicans, replacements, incumbents, divides, base, contenders, races, bucks, reports, death, tonic, health",0.39267121767121765,0.0899320124320124,0.0

"I commented earlier before I had the chance to actually read through the articles you posted. [This article](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition) you linked about “local governments overstating access” actually claims the opposite. It says that the FCC relied on data provided by the ISPs, and the ISPs are the ones claiming an area is served even when only a single house in a zip code has internet access. 

What we really need to do is change the way the FCC counts broadband access. There’s currently an initiative by the new FCC to do just that as well.

https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-370049A1.pdf

If this works out, and the FCC raises the standard of broadband, it could make a huge difference and provide more reliable, and cheaper internet to consumers with a larger number of potential providers to choose from.

"Joe Biden was voted in because he's a houseplant and moderates and Dems wanted a return to normalcy. He was the supposedly moderate, safe option that wasn't Trump. 

People actually don't like the radical policies coming out of the Biden admin. They don't actually like friendly old Joe and his 300%% increase in border crossing interactions and the packed facilities he said were inhumane and racist. The Dems are great at virtue signaling but SUCK at effectuating good policy. 

Dem Climate change solution? Tank american oil. Ignore that we'll have to still import it for all sorts of products.. Also that China and India are the main polluters and have no plan on stepping off the gas. Maybe do another Solyndra boondoggle.

Volatile economic recovery? The recovery will go exactly as fast as the restrictions are lifted. Over 100M americans have been vaccinated. Teachers are holding out in spite of evidence they should be back in school. But trusty old plagiarist Joe knows his party is beholden to the teacher's unions

Once in a generation plague? I'll agree with that. I'd also agree that Biden talks loudly (due to his hearing aid going out) and carries a tiny stick when it comes to China (who in all likelihood is responsible for the pandemic.)

Wow. How do we recover? How about we figure out that locking down the US where we can't even lock down the southern border is not like locking down New Zealand. Less dependency on PPE from overseas.

In states where those guidelines don't exist, there is still a lot of social/economic pressure for businesses to verify vaccine status of their patrons (e.g. other people may be more likely to go there if passports are required). 

The bottom line is that there's plenty of legal precedent for private businesses to have any requirements of entry they want. They're allowed to require certain clothes or styles of dress, that their patrons be of a certain age, or that everyone have a tattoo of a money on their buttcheek. The only thing they can't do is discriminate against a protected class. At the federal level, these are currently defined as race, color, country of origin, religion, sex/orientation, disability, and family status. Personal ethics/politics/preferences about vaccines is not a protected class. 

Some people may try to argue a ""religious"" opposition to vaccines, but in reality there are no organized religious groups that don't allow them. I know that religion is personal to everyone, but it would be very hard to prove legally that a preference for not being vaccinated is due to your religion. And there is already pecedent for vaccination status not being tied to religion in this way, as several states do not have religious or personal exemptions to vaccines for school entry (meaning kids can be turned away from public schools if their families choose not to vaccinate). 

As for the disability class, it is possible that some people's inability to be vaccinated is due to a physical disability or medical condition. There are already discussions being had about how to exempt those individuals from the passport. The reality is though, for that small group of medically fragile people, they are likely not interacting with the public any time soon, regardless of passports. If your immune system is too jacked for a non-live vaccine, it's still just way too dangerous right now for them to risk exposure in public.",1617921385.0,gtv6hq3,t1_gtqc682,/r/Conservative/comments/mm1c64/another_governor_just_banned_government_mandated/gtv6hq3/,1.0,1617935785.0,"businesses, institutions, flu, guidelines, number, employees, t1_gtqc682, weeks, sense, steps, likelihood, states, lot, pressure, vaccine, status, patrons, people, passports, line, plenty, precedent, requirements, entry, clothes, styles, dress, age, tattoo, money, buttcheek, thing, class, level, race, color, country, origin, religion, sex, orientation, disability, family, ethics, politics, preferences, vaccines, opposition, reality, groups, preference, vaccination, way, exemptions, school, kids, schools, families, inability, condition, discussions, individuals, passport, group, public, time, system, exposure",0.4272227375798805,0.014583075654504217,0.0

"I laugh at people who say Trump was a Russian spy. The intelligence committee, Robert Mueller’s report, and even a GOP lead senate panel provided reports with evidence of russia not only interfering in the 2016 election but having ties to the trump campaign. Trump had so many nicknames and terrible things to say about every world leader except Putin. Why do you think that is? Why do you think he publicly sided with Putin over the US Intelligence Agency who had evidence of Russia interfering in the 2016 elections? Why do you think Trump never once denounced or took action against Russia for putting bounties on US soldiers heads? Sounds like republicans bury their heads in the sand to the facts and evidence because it doesn’t fit their narrative.


On January 6, Trump said “we are going to walk down and I’ll be there with you. We are going to walk down to the Capitol. We are going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong.” I agree that some of them headed towards the capitol during his speech but all the rest of his supporters went after his speech per his direction.

"its hard to know without actually seeing the contract, but in general, its not unusual for bidders on a contract to front load a contract, or some other similar form of shifting money around.

what i mean is (this is all generally speaking. experience may vary based on contracts), contractors get paid as they complete work, so they may jack up the bid cost to perform early tasks.  for example, if im building a playground, i may say that the early earthwork costs more than it actually does so that i get paid more money earlier in the job.

however, under normal bid jobs, this doesnt do you any favors against competition.  so to balance out higher earlier charges, you lower the charges for later work (think finishing, final detail work).  In the end, your *total* bid is whats important, not the details of how you came to that number.

Who cares if you charge $25k for a hammer, if you charge $10 for a new car, vs charging $10 for a hammer and $25k for the car.

no-bid jobs though are a bit trickier, but you would still have to look at all the line items and the entire final cost to figure out if the total costs were reasonable.",1617919079.0,gtv1lee,t1_gttsyk9,/r/Conservative/comments/mmowyb/dave_chappelle_says_celebrities_left_dirty_notes/gtv1lee/,1.0,1617933479.0,"contract, bidders, front, form, money, experience, contracts, contractors, work, bid, cost, tasks, example, playground, earthwork, job, jobs, favors, competition, charges, finishing, detail, end, total, details, number, 25k, hammer, car, bit, line, items, costs",0.5382856341189675,0.06322951739618407,0.0

2) Officers are not expected to begin medical treatment if the situation is unsafe to do so. The increasingly hostile crowd made it unsafe. Especially when you considered Floyd would have to be rolled over and have the handcuffs removed for chest compressions to begin 

3) In fact, the scene was so hostile that the ambulance that arrived had to do a “load and scoot”. That means they were unable to render immediate life-saving measures on the scene because it was unsafe to do so, thus leading to an additional delay in Floyd’s medical treatment. In addition to that, because the ambulance had to relocate due to the load and scoot, the firefighters that were called to the scene had difficulty finding the ambulance in its relocation thus causing even more delay.

"Your comment is conflating a few things which are better addressed individually.

First, how many of the perpetrators in your links were abusing dead voters on the voting registration lists? By my count, of what you posted so far, none. So yeah, the voter registration issue shows clerical errors so far, not fraud. The data constantly erodes over time without malfeasance (no one is intentionally ""keeping dead voters there"").

Second, as stated above, I agree with the point that dead people don't belong on voter registration lists. The question is how dangerous is the potential for abuse - where should fixing the issue go in our national priorities. It's my opinion that individually-falsified votes is a non-issue compared to the larger systemic issues with our electoral integrity (eg, electronic voting machines which have a pretty high risk of abuse and hit way more than one vote at a time, foreign media campaigns targeting voters with misinformation, the rise of social media as de facto political turf with unbridled partisan hatred breeding extremism, etc). These are orders of magnitude more important, in my prioritization.

Third, you're levying a ""racism"" attack at someone who has not used an argument related to race. Think about that for a second. You're so aggrieved that people might use ""race"" as a bad faith argument, that you are now actually using ""race"" as a bad faith argument.

I agree that we need to pursue election integrity and that it should be a non-partisan issue. I just see [zero proof](https://ballotpedia.org/Votes_cast_in_the_names_of_deceased_people) that dead people on the voting registration lists should be registering anywhere near the top of that list of priorities. So what I see in OP's article linked above, and echoed continually in this thread, is a mass hysteria machine attempting to leverage half the country against the other half about a non-issue.

"President Biden has pitched his nearly $2.3 trillion spending proposal as a vital investment in the U.S. economy, but the proposed tax hikes that would fund the sweeping measure could kill close to 1 million jobs. 

That's according to a study released Thursday by the National Association of Manufacturers, which found that 1 million jobs will disappear within two years if the president's proposed tax increases are approved.

""This study tells us quantitatively what manufacturers from coast to coast will tell you qualitatively: increasing the tax burden on companies in America means fewer American jobs,"" said NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons.

The Treasury Department on Wednesday released details of Biden's tax plan, which aims to raise $2.5 trillion over 15 years to finance his sweeping spending initiative, dubbed the American Jobs Plan. That includes raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, imposing a new minimum tax on global profits and cracking down on companies that try to move profits offshore.

But boosting taxes on corporations could shrink the nation's GDP by $117 billion in 2023 and $190 billion in 2026, according to the study, conducted by Rice University economists John Diamond and George Zodrow. Those figures assumed a repeal of the 20% deduction for pass-through businesses, increasing the top income tax rate and raising the corporate tax rate to 28%. 

""The conclusion of this study is inescapable—follow through with tax hikes that give other countries a clear advantage and we’ll see far fewer jobs created in America,"" Timmons said.

The tax increases would fund massive investments in the nation's roads and bridges, as well as transit systems, schools and hospitals. 

But the White House is already facing headwinds over the proposal: Both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable, which is comprised of CEOs from some of the nation's biggest companies, warned that forcing corporations to pay more in federal taxes would ultimately derail the economy's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.

Biden indicated on Wednesday that he's willing to lower the proposed corporate tax increase amid pushback from Republicans and some moderate Democrats, who have raised concerns that the tax increases could derail the economy's recovery from the pandemic and hurt U.S. competitiveness abroad.

""I'm willing to listen to that,"" Biden said when asked at the White House whether he would consider a corporate tax rate lower than 28%. ""I'm wide open. But we've got to pay for this. There are many other ways we could it. But I'm willing to negotiate that.""

The corporate tax increase would generate about $740 billion in new revenue over the next decade, according to a recent analysis published by the Tax Policy Center.

"A lot of things have changed since the Constitution was ratified. The Bill of Rights was originally a list of things the federal government couldn't do, but that didn't prohibit states from enacting laws contradictory to the BOR. States generally mirrored the Constitution and created their own versions of the BOR. 

The purpose of the 2nd amendment was to avoid neutering state militias and empower a standing federal army. Obviously that system of self defense hasn't been in effect for 150+ years. 

It wasn't until the 14th amendment was ratified that the process of incorporating the BOR against the states began. The 2nd was the last to be incorporated in DC v. Heller (thank you, Scalia) but the SC hasn't taken any gun rights cases since then and there is still a lot of muddy understanding of what governments can or can't do with respect to gun ownership.

"Easy.

Victims of domestic abuse should not be subjected to lengthy, laborous, and costly firearms restrictions in order to protect themselves from their abusers. End of story.

There are thousands of incidences every year of victims preventing fatal harm to themselves or their families by using firearms defensively. 

If that's not good enough here's another angle.

Leftists and Liberals love to tout how laws while innocuous in writing are racist in execution.

Gun control will undoubtedly be used to further oppress and harass black Americans.

We already have the proof of this in history with stop and frisk laws. Reagan and California enforced strict gun control as a direct method to disarm Black Panthers.

Any gun control law will be used to disproportionately target the poor and the minorities. The rich will maintain their own self defense via armed licensed security guards or via using influence and wealth to attain costly government permits.

There is already proof again of this in New York. The state has some of the most restrictive and bureaucratic concealed carry systems and it limits those able to gain the right to self defense solely to the rich. More proof is the current case in San Francisco were the sheriff's office has been accused of taking bribes in order to issue concealed carry permits.

Still not enough?

Here's another argument.

The past year has seen a considerable drop in the trust of police nation wide. Many are out there calling for defunding or abolishing the police. Without the ability to protect yourself with a firearm you are placing that sole power into the very hands of the police. It is ironic that the same people spewing hatred of the police also want the very same officers to round up and disarm them. 

By their own chants they claim that the police are racist oppressors but at the same time want those racist oppressors to be the only ones with guns.

And back to placing your self defense in the hands of the police. Multiple Supreme Court cases have upheld the decision that Police are NOT legally obligated to render service, aide, or protection. Therefore any wise citizen should realize that the only person they can rely on to protect them is themselves.

We saw this during the Florida school shooting when one of the Deputies that refused to enter the school. He was fired but later sued and won.

"&gt; It's not required for a polling company to go back to the same people to conduct a poll, or to compare polls. Why do you believe that's required? 

I never said it was required? In fact, it might even be poor polling design to recruit the exact same people to answer the same questions at a later date if you are trying to generalize their answers to the population they represent (in this case, American voters).

&gt;Biden's poll numbers have sunk on immigration. It means he went from a high point to a lower point in polling on the issue of immigration. This is true. The article is not making a false assertion even if they didn't provide the information.

Why are you talking about immigration policy? That's very broad, and the article was specifically about what's going on at the border right now. You can't compare the results of the poll question referenced in this article to the results of other poll questions asking people for their opinions of Biden's immigration policy in general. That would be like me asking you ""Hey, what did you think  of such-and-such actor in this new movie?"", you responding, ""He sucked, his performance was terrible"", and then me going on to say ""u/Roez thinks that such-and-such actor is terrible at acting in general"". You very well may have that opinion about that actor, but nothing you said to me suggests you feel that way.

Bringing it back to this article: People think that Biden isn't handling the current situation at the border very well, as this poll suggests. But how he's handling the current situation is just one facet of his immigration policy, so we shouldn't just assume that these same people more generally think his immigration policy is terrible.

"&gt;How do Undocumented Workers File Tax Returns Without a Valid Social Security Number?

&gt;Though certain non-citizens are eligible for to receive Social Security numbers to pay taxes, unauthorized immigrants are ineligible to receive one. However, it is still law that individuals who reside in the United States, whether legally or not, and earn income here must pay taxes on that income, and file a tax return, regardless of whether the income was earned as an undocumented worker—a complicated legal conundrum.
Further, the IRS will not allow a tax return to be filed with a fake or stolen Social Security number. Therefore, unauthorized workers who wish to file their taxes–and potentially get future credit for it— must find another way. Thus, many use the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, which allows immigrants without Social Security numbers to legally file tax returns and claim the income reported on their W-2’s to the IRS

There were a lot more links to paste. How many clerical errors before we decide there is a problem? Dead people on voter rolls may not in and of themselves be a fraudulent vote, however opportunists may still take advantage of the fact that they are there. And that is only one avenue for fraud. 

Again, why keep them on there if they are dead.  One person one vote, right? They are dead, and there is no need to keep them there.

"I guess I'm the sole person that actually read the article?  The ""Biden tie"" is a fairly misleading title... the ""tie"" is that the contract was given to a former transition team member.  Not even a staffer or personal friend, just a transition team member.  

So who is this transition team member? Well, even the article goes over their pretty impressive resume given the project:

* Worked at ICE from 2008 to 2019

* Said job at ICE eventually resulted in their overseeing operations across 39 states in providing child welfare services

* While on the transition team, they vetted appointees for the Department of Health and Human Services

So what about the organization that won the contract under him? Well, they've been around for 50+ years, they're Texas-based (specifically San Antonio), and their main focus since ~2007 has been housing, job training, homeless prevention, mental health services, and more.  Prior to this, they spent 30+ years launching food banks and health services for youths and elderly.  They've furthermore taken contracts from numerous government organizations over the years and have exceeded all expectations.  Is this a big contract for them? Sure.  Is this out of their expertise? Not even close.

"&gt; We vote for said GOP reps who keep Mitch in power. So we are the root cause of this problem.

that is always the root problem. As a whole congress has a truly terrible approval rate for both sides of the aisle. But each side just keeps voting in the same people over and over again. Part of that is party chicanery during the primaries to keep people the party heads like. The other is gerrymandering to an extreme extent in some states. 

The gerrymandering issue results in safe districts. Then suddenly in your solid district, it isn't really who is the candidate who appeals to the most people. It is the candidate who appeals only the most to that subset of people. Then it isn't left/right it is far-left vs left. Gerrymandering is a big source of why our politics are so divided currently.

One is the Bernie Sanders (communist) model, where the [government owns the means of production.](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/14/politics/kfile-bernie-nationalization)  The other is the Elizabeth Warren (fascist) model, where there is ostensibly a market and companies, but in reality [they are directed by the government, ostensibly for the ""greater good.""](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/elizabeth-warren-corporatism-progressive-ideological-ends/)  As Kevin D. Williamson said, you don't actually have to take over the factory if you act like you own the factory.  
  
&gt;Also, I think it is important to understand that the green new deal is what is believed by many scientist to be the bare minimum that we need to do to protect our planet before it is to the point of global catastrophe.  
  
The COVID pandemic really should have taught you all you need to know about the ""LISTEN TO THE SCIENCE!"" mantra.  Scientists are fixated on one issue and one issue only, but the reality is that there are competing goods that need to be balanced.  People like Fauci only think about one issue: the death rate.  Because we punted these decisions to people who only consider one issue, we’ve stolen a year of education from our children, driven people to despair and suicide and addiction, ruined countless small businesses, put people out of work, devasted the rental and housing markets, etc.  
  
The parallel to the global warming industry should be obvious.  They only consider one thing, the temperature.  But that has to be balanced against employment, housing costs, travel expenses, the cost of heating homes, reliability of electricity, etc.  And this is all assuming that the global warming industry is acting in good faith, which it isn’t.  Nuclear power is our best chance of reducing emissions, but the Green New Deal explicitly says no new nuclear power.    
  
&gt; So if you don't believe in global warming, then it is clear why you would be afraid of the GND.  
  
I do believe in global warming.  But it’s not the only thing I worry about.  The fundamental flaw in the leftist mindset is that you think life is just a series of unrelated levers, and pulling one doesn’t affect another.  You think we have a problem with policing, so you think we can just pull the “defund the police” lever and everything will be fixed.  The explosion of homicides in Democrat run cities should have disabused you of that notion.  
  
&gt; I also find it interesting that you are convinced that the only home grown terrorism is from the left.  
  
I didn’t say that.  But there’s an obvious issue of scale here.  The Klan didn’t burn down Minneapolis.  Everyone hates the Klan, but the media and corporations are firmly in the pocket of the BLM terrorists.  This makes BLM a far bigger threat.  
  
&gt; Not aware of the massive increase of violent attacks on minorities in the past 4 years.

"You actually think you can tell how competent someone is by *how* they talk? The manner of what they say isn't important, it's the general context or bigger picture that matters always.

People like you are easily fooled, that's why you get corrupt fake politicians in the first place - the truth is you prefer their nice sounding lies to the hard reality of an honest person. You won't admit that to yourself, but deep down that's at the root of your thought process here that destines you to be nothing but an easily manipulated lemming for the rest of your life.

The first thing you learn about brainstorming is that there's no such thing as a stupid idea. Candid, open discussion and thinking out loud shouldn't be a net ""turn off"" for you, that's actual a very practical and refreshing quality to have in a politician. The only reason you think otherwise is because you fall for media conditioning and manufactured mob outrage over nothing.

Normal people realize that it's stupid to judge someone's intelligence based on the manner that they speak. In fact, those who ""sound smart"" tend to be less intelligent (if you hired people in any practical field you'd quickly pick up on that). People who talk like Trump are people who tend to be competent because they focus their energy more on substance than appearance.

"But I didn't actually see him exposing corruption. I saw him exposing corruption from his political opponents. That's no different than anyone previously. He definitely had his own style like no one before, but when he went after Biden (either the father or the son ) it didn't seem like it was because they had done something wrong. It seemed like it was because they did something wrong and weren't on his team. His choice of pardons really drove that home.

For me, had he exposed the corruption from everyone, Democrat or Republican, it would have cemented his place as a person trying to bring honesty back to the capital. Now it just looks like after any other president who tried to bury his opponents in political scandals while burying his own parties.

He was the primary supporter of the Smithsonian Institution. 

Adams had a stroke, then recovered, and returned to office. Adams was against the Mexican-American war from the beginning and a  matter aimed at honoring the US army soldiers in that war came up. When voting in favor came up, Adams rose from his chair and yelled “NO!”. Adams collapsed immediately after and suffered a brain hemorrhage which lead to his death.

"Well, let’s be honest here.  Voting laws in this country are a shit show...  They vary from state to state &amp; aren’t generally kept current with the changes in society.  I don’t doubt that there are verifiable cases of partisan fuckery, but in most cases they were trying to find a way to keep voter turnout in the midst of an almost unprecedented global catastrophe.  This may not have happened if we had a coordinated Federal effort to manage the pandemic.  For instance, I’ve seen public surveys prior to the election cycle that showed large numbers of people were most anxious about voting in person because of the lack of a mask mandate.  Throughout the first year of the pandemic &amp; largely still today, Republican leadership have publicly scoffed at the use of masks.  A mask mandate in a pandemic isn’t a restriction of personal liberty any more than making people wear a seatbelt.  

So the bottom line on this topic is simple - in the absence of Federal oversight, the states were scrambling to be sure that people turned out to vote &amp; the obvious &amp; simple path to any honest observer would be to expand absentee ballots.

I have ""lost"" friends over the politics in this country.

I'm really not but that's your method of attack and a way to push voters to be against this. Like every leftist policy you only look at symptom of a problem and never the source of the issue. Its getting old and i wish people would wake up to it.

4) There is no fact based need to ""improve integrity in our elections"" as evidenced by the lack of evidence of fraud

There's that lack of evidence argument again. Of course there will never be evidence if you never look for it. 

5) Nothing is being let go. We are holding on dearly to the right to vote

Your right to vote was never in danger in the first place. I guess my right to bear arms is gone because i have to show an ID to purchase a firearm then?

"No one wants to come here to live in South Dakota is the issue there. If we could say take an additional ""x"" number of immigrants each year if they lived in the area they were placed based on the current US population distribution we could probably take on more.

"The big issue with internet is in the county I live in 70% of school age kids (kids in the school they did a survey last summer) have zero access to internet outside of satellite. That means these kids max internet is less than 25 MBS and it’s expensive. Something needs done to reach these kids with broadband. (Even DSL would change their lives)They need the internet to be able to learn woth the BS distance learning they are pushing. The kids have to come to school one day a week to download all the lessons from the week before so they have no access too a teacher except 1 day a week.

1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back.

4. Compare yourself with who you were yesterday, not with who someone else is today.

"&gt; what recourse does an official have 

Lawsuit in his personal capacity not in official capacity. Government and public officials are two different things in textbook setting.

But I can't say that for a public official Ron Desantis without Ron Desantis a US citizen being able to sue me.

"&gt;It’s high time for every American that thinks there was significant voter fraud in the last election to demand all of the evidence that the Trump campaign allegedly collected be published publicly in it’s entirety. 

Voter FRAUD has not been proven. What HAS been proven is that states violated their state consitutions to alter how elections are handled. And guess what? Trump won a lawsuit on that. Did you know that?

For the record, I don't think Gina should have been fired for her twitter escapades.  ""Ham-fisted"" is a really great way to describe her communication style.

2.the power grid upgrade should be its own thing cause again it’s probably gonna take more money than they are giving it and need a way to be funded in the future. 

3. Elderly care in no way should be in this bill. Those facilities should be tried for murder before we hand them billions of dollars. 

When it comes down to it some of the stuff is needed and it’s expensive as crap. It could be a trillion dollars to get every person equal access to broadband and Another trillion to update the power grid to handle the electric car load but the way the bill is laid out is to fund pet projects within the greater need and is gonna be a waste of money.

"&gt;Because tons of Republicans/Trumpists want zero immigration.

Obviously some on the right do believe this but as someone that is a conservative that voted for Trump,  indulges in conservative media on various platforms and knows other conservatives in real life I believe you are grossly overestimating this when you say ""tons"".

&gt;Mexico is refusing.

refusing what exactly? didn't we have a ""remain in Mexico"" policy until recently, meaning that asylum seekers waited in Mexico for their hearing?

&gt;And what do you do with people that claim political persecution or death threats?

Well you do not let them roam freely within the country. Keeping them in Mexico or holding them until their case is heard is the best scenario I suppose. I believe it also matters how they came into the US, as crossing illegally is still a federal crime. No one should be rewarded for breaking federal law.

Also, if someone from, let us say El Salvador is ""escaping"" political persecution of death threats, why wouldn't they stay in Mexico?

Apr 7, 2021 - The White House released a fact sheet announcing that President Joe Biden will use the Department of Justice (DOJ) to publish model red flag “legislation,” address AR-pistols with stabilizer braces, and issue a rule to “stop the proliferation of ‘ghost guns.'”

https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/07/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-initial-actions-to-address-the-gun-violence-public-health-epidemic/

Breitbart News reported that Biden planned to put forward executive action on gun controls Thursday, and the fact sheet provides an outline detailing what those actions may entail.

According to the White House:

The Justice Department, within 60 days, will publish model “red flag” legislation for states.

The Justice Department, within 60 days, will issue a proposed rule to make clear when a device marketed as a stabilizing brace effectively turns a pistol into a short-barreled rifle subject to the requirements of the National Firearms Act.

The Justice Department, within 30 days, will issue a proposed rule to help stop the proliferation of “ghost guns.”...",1617893400.0,gtte0ei,t3_mmtfpm,/r/Conservative/comments/mmtfpm/white_house_joe_biden_not_waiting_on_congress/gtte0ei/,1.0,1617907800.0,"t3_mmtfpm, https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/04/07/white-house-biden-not-waiting-congress-using-doj-gun-control/, fact, sheet, model, flag, legislation, address, pistols, stabilizer, braces, rule, proliferation, ghost, guns, action, gun, controls, outline, actions, days, states, device, brace, pistol, rifle, requirements",0.2020833333333333,0.07916666666666668,0.0

You're right about the special interest funding, I'll wait for the mega millions to get big and try to get rich that way lol. 

I'd make marijuana one of my cornerstones lolol. There's a lot of profit and environmental benefits that would please both profiteers and the environmentalists. Like 1 acre of hemp/marijuana plants produces 2-3x the amount of O2 from the CO2 conversion vs an acre of trees. 

And what better way to get the ""criminals"" who were jailed for growing operations of large scale to earn their keep again. They have untapped knowledge that could produce quality products. 

I have some influence from Starship Troopers when it comes to people being useful to society and earning your way and that if we collectively shut up about the stupid shit we could accomplish a lot. 

One of my ideas based off the influence would be to start a ""Natural Disaster Corp"" have focused training for regions based on what happens in areas. So out west earthquake/firefighting, south floods, etc. This option of service would be focused at 18-24 year olds who may not have college as an option, dont want to join the military, and a way for them to learn skills that they can use later in life.

"That's a very good point, as all of my maternal ancestors came here that way and have done so since at least the arrival of William Galt, Sr., a prominent businessman of the Galt family and a maternal uncle of John Allan, later the *de facto* adoptive father of Edgar Allan Poe. Allan also became my fourth-great-grandfather through one of his unacknowledged sons. Not one record of that branch of the family indicates that any of them ever got into legal trouble with immigration officials.

Many more of my maternal ancestors came here through the same means during the Irish potato blight. We haven't a single record of illegal immigration from that branch of the family, either. My family also emphasized respectful, dedicated faith, respect, and work as the most effective ways to succeed here in America.

"I mean you guys are really reading these articles?

&gt;The document uses the term ""equity"" a total of 21 times, yet, revealingly, never defines the word.

&gt;So, what is equity? Joe Biden never tells us, never even hints.... We know that it will be everywhere. But we’re not allowed to know what it is. That’s odd.

That IS odd for a government order, let's take a look at the executive order.

&gt; Sec. 2.  Definitions.  For purposes of this order:  (a)  The term “equity” means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. 

&gt; (b)  The term “underserved communities” refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life, as exemplified by the list in the preceding definition of “equity.”   

Why would Tucker Carlson lie in the first paragraph, and reference the document he is lying about. That's odd!

&gt;The new United is very different. It’s a combination of a hyper-aggressive corporate HR department, and a left-wing political action committee

Uh huh. 

&gt;When Coca-Cola embraces some equity scheme, you can understand why: they’re hoping that by hiring more Black executives, no one will ask how many Black Americans have gotten diabetes from drinking Coke. For Coca-Cola, equity is purely a defensive PR move, and it makes sense.

What? Wait WHAT? What the fuck Tucker! Why would you write that unprompted in an article about airlines...

&gt;""Only 7% of United pilots are female!"" fretted CBS. ""Only 13% aren’t White!"" OK, but why exactly should we care about those numbers? 

I think that should be pretty obvious....

&gt;An airline pilot’s job is to land the plane safely. Everything else is irrelevant. If 100% of United pilots were Black women, or Malaysian Muslims, or for that matter, White men from Alabama, not a single sane person would complain about it as long as the airplanes didn’t crash.

The armies job is to keep America safe. If 0% of officers are black or women, no one should care so long as America is safe!

&gt;""United Airlines will continue to uphold its high standards,"" they told us. But they’re lying.

Huh? I assume there is going to be some statistical analysis that shows that diversity initiatives result in lower standards at airlines?

&gt;So if hiring on the basis of irrelevant criteria will, over time, get people killed

Wait what? Huh? I missed the part where you explained that one. Diversity initiatives will result in higher rates of plane crashes? You have some kind of statistic to back this up right?

&gt;The new head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, a Black supremacist called Kristen Clarke, admitted as much.

&gt; CLARKE: Federal agencies should hire the best, but place a premium on diversity..


These articles are some high level propaganda outrage machine. Like strawmanning every argument and then saying facts without any backing.

"*Steering* a plane, as in the physical act of making the plane do what you want, is usually pretty easy. There are situations where a plane can behave in very unexpected ways, especially with more complex aircraft. This is why being a test pilot is particularly dangerous, as new and experimental aircraft can sometimes have quirks that no one has figured out yet. But for a long established model of aircraft, like most airliners are, its usually pretty straight forward. With a little practice, most people can make a plane do what they want, including the take off and landing parts. When I was in flight school we had all that stuff down in the first week.

*Piloting* a plane, as in the mental activity of not just steering the plane, but also doing everything in a safe manner, within certain regulations and guidelines, for the entire duration of a flight, is hard. Being able to navigate visually, as well as being able to navigate by all sorts of different instruments - everything from a compass and a watch to modern GPS systems. Knowing all the little quirks of your plane, knowing what it will do even in uncommon or extreme situations. Not just having Plan A memorized, but also Plan B and Plan C if things needs to change. Knowing how all the many systems in the plane interact with eachother. Knowing how to handle all kinds of different emergencies. That's the hard stuff, and while you learn it all at a basic level in flight school, its an ongoing process to master these things.

A great example of this is the ""Miracle on the Hudson"". At the time, the emergency checklist for losing engine power in the A320 had starting the Auxiliary Power Unit as one of the last items. Normally the engines also provide electrical power to the plane. The APU is usually used to provide electrical power on the ground while the engines are off, but it's also there to provide power in the event the engines no longer can. The problem is, you need some power to start the APU in the first place. If the engines go out you'll have residual power available for around a minute. If you don't start the APU while you still have that residual power available, you won't be starting the APU at all. Which means no electricity. Which means no radios, no lights, and worst of all, no control over the airplane. The published procedure for the A320 had starting the APU as one of the last items in the checklist. Capt. Sullenberger ignored that and did that immediately. He did that because he understood all of what I just wrote. A less experienced pilot who didn't have that understanding of the aircraft's systems would have just followed procedure, probably lost electrical power, and winds up crashing into some neighborhood in White Plains.",1617891935.0,gttas7t,t1_gts463x,/r/Conservative/comments/mmksh8/tucker_carlson_pilot_ability_no_longer_matters_to/gttas7t/,1.0,1617906335.0,"plane, act, situations, ways, aircraft, test, pilot, quirks, one, model, airliners, practice, people, parts, flight, school, stuff, week, activity, manner, regulations, guidelines, duration, sorts, instruments, compass, watch, GPS, systems, t1_gts463x, things, interact, eachother, kinds, emergencies, level, process, example, Miracle, Hudson, time, emergency, checklist, engine, power, A320, items, engines, ground, event, problem, place, minute, electricity, radios, lights, control, airplane, procedure, understanding, winds, neighborhood",0.4918210678210679,0.11116854256854257,0.0

1) That's not how evidence works. If you want to make a broad, sweeping claim, it does not get the slightest credibility until you provide evidence.

Even large corporations have security audits, why shouldn't our election processes? With security it isn't about proving whether it is secure or not its about confirming whether its secure or not.

2) There is no lowering of security nor a security hole. There is only keeping the status quo that we know is a safe and secure method.

How do we do its safe? Saying you shouldn't need to show ID to vote is a massive security hole, i don't see how anyone could deny that.

3) 11% of the eligible voting population does not have an ID. This is not ""very few people"" and it's ironic you'd even suggest that when your entire argument is ""even one illegal vote is too many""

Nice projection

4) Your desire for voter ID laws is clearly agenda-based and clearly not reality-based. You clearly do not understand the barriers to getting ID. You clearly do not understand who is most affected by these laws. You clearly do not understand the lack of a need for these laws.

Its not based on agenda its based on improving integrity in our elections. If anything the agenda would be to not have it, it makes zero sense no to. Please explain the lack of need for this because you clearly haven't said it despite my many reasons explaining why its a poor idea.

And I only said a respectable single shot, and I would give them an option of their weapon. If they live in a rural area and wish to do more hunting - then let them have a long barrel rifle. If they live in an urban area and have no plans for hunting, then let them have a handgun. 

And I am not asking them to be hostage negotiators. Like you said, they need to have an understanding and respect for firearms. We need to instill in a mindset that every effort must be made to NOT have to use a weapon but if it comes to that they will absolutely know how to use one and be able to exercise the weapon without endangering anyone other than their attacker.",1617890427.0,gtt7j97,t1_gtt58f0,/r/Conservative/comments/mm1i9s/ohios_new_stand_your_ground_gun_law_takes_effect/gtt7j97/,1.0,1617904827.0,"gt, firearm, danger, target, shooting, de, -, escalation, weapon, knowledge, t1_gtt58f0, shot, option, area, hunting, barrel, rifle, plans, handgun, hostage, negotiators, understanding, respect, firearms, mindset, effort, attacker",0.4938775510204082,0.1197356215213358,0.0

"Okay let’s do a scenario. Say you’ve just been released from prison and are lucky enough to get a job, even though it’s minimum wage. You work your ass off, but the money isn’t enough to cover rent and food(since there is no public housing) and no other place will hire you for more pay. You resort to stealing food from a grocery store and get arrested and go back to prison. Now the Government (taxpayers) is responsible for housing you and it costs ~$3,000 a month (way more than what the public housing would have cost). 

Public housing is a social safety net where the benefits far outweigh the costs. Some people just need a little bit of help sometimes where yeah they might have a minimum wage job, but in a few years they find a better job and move out of the public housing. The average stay in HUD is 5.9 years (median 3 years), so it’s not like people care staying in public housing their entire lives. Do people take advantage of it?

"The benefit to gain by upping voting security is far outweighed by the amount of money that would need to be spent to further upgrade the infrastructure and personnel needed to work these new systems. How would you suppose we garner the money necessary to upgrade this? Would you then support tax increases needed to fund this new infrastructure? This seems to conflict with conservatives views of no unnecessary spending. As a leftist, I find it absolutely mental to spend potentially millions of dollars to stop one fraudulent vote. 

People die from car crashes everyday. Do you want to lower the speed limit to 15 mph universally so people don’t drive at lethal speeds? Absolutely no you wouldn’t, we have interstates and highways in place to quickly transport goods to benefit our economy. There’s a net benefit to having roads designated to high speeds between cities. It’s a commodity that Americans have decided is a net positive regardless of how many people are killed in car crashes. 

This is like voter fraud. The amount of spending necessary to set up these infrastructures (IMO) is an over correction to what is an incredibly fringe issue.  Unless you want to introduce laws that require higher amounts of voter restriction for “security”, the net cost we would have to spend per fraudulent vote would be absolute lunacy.

"&gt; but companies don't offshore unless it results in lower costs so they can undercut their competition.

No...outsourcing wasn't a reaction, it was something that was enacted through laws and trade agreement. Like for example NAFTA (although it first ramped up under Reagan). My point of the population paying for it, which you seem to be oblivious about, was that its main function, and the primary reason for the improved profits from it, was completely undermining the working class. They moved outside the country for cheaper, while at the same time completely ruining the bargaining hand of the working class and their ability to push for higher wages. It's no surprise that both the outsourcing and anti-union laws of the 70s and 80s is right around the same time when real wages of the American middle class has grounded to a halt--despite the fact that their productivity has reason. When productivity goes up, but you don't pay your employees more money, what do you think that leads to? HIGHER PROFITS. Who has paid for this? Employees.

Who has paid for outsourcing? Employees. 

&gt;I'm a Teamster. I support collective bargaining, but unions abuse their power just as much as corps do.

That's simply false. As teamster you should be well aware of its history, and it was one where its incredible bargaining power was used to increase wages that was nominally following the productivity increase of their workers. The teamsters were the first to get shafted in the neoliberal policies, under Carter, and it was of complete illegitimate reasons.

Every actor are self-interested, unions no less. But if you actually take a look at the record and look at the wage increases of the working class in the 50s, 60s and early 70s, and compare it to both improvement in productivity and the overall profit of the companies they worked for, what you find is that it wasn't any kind of ""abuse"" of power on rational grounds.

&gt;If the goal of social programs is to reduce poverty, the lowest poverty rate in history was just prior to covid.

For the US? No. Poverty rate, as well as inequality, has increased substantially in Western countries. Globally it has decreased, but that's misleading, as it's skewed by the improved economic condition of countries like China and India, as well as a great many African countries. The goal of social programs is precisely to reduce poverty and inequality, and to improve living standards. 

&gt;I have ""actually read"" them. Friedman repeatedly says that Washington always asks for advise from economists, but then never takes it.

Which is strange, given the economic policy shift in the late 70s was one influenced, and heralded by, the Chicago Boys. From economic advisors to actual real positions (like Federal Reserve chairmen). Same with all the neoliberal economists since then, who have been proudly defending the system. It isn't a matter of opinion that we moved away New Deal politics to a more monetarist one focusing on low inflation, nor is it that we saw a great shift towards more privatization, deregulation and cut of public programs. The fact that neoliberalism is neither very liberal or very new is no secret--but that it is the description of the kind of economic system shift we saw from the US/Britain in the late 70s, and then most of the rest of the world in the 80s and 90s, is a fact.

Just as it's a fact that from 1930s to 1970s there was a more Keynesian macroeconomic policy going on (not in the entire world--the third world, at least those areas that were under domination of Western powers, were subjected to the ""free market"" and the penetration of our companies, to our advantage), which was protectionist and socialdemocratic in nature. Despite the fact that Keynes himself was not all too happy about it all, as he felt not all of his advises were followed.

I simply pointed out the contradiction of the current policies, which is honestly the case for any kind of illegitimate power structure--they have to lie to justify their existence. And that includes this sub, btw, as they seem to be great admirers of people like Reagan on the basis of ""free market"" policies. The reality is that the system we have today hasn't killed of Keynesian--it just has kept it for big business, while the free market instruments have only been applied in ways that have been for their benefit, and also mostly for the detriment of the populace as a whole (like say outsourcing, privatization and cut of social spending, undermining of unions, and so on).

"It’s nigh impossible Lee Zeldin could depend on NYC for votes since it consistently votes for Democrats (80/20 D/R) for mayoral (&amp; city council)/gubernatorial/legislative/presidential elections, so that’s expected to give him a profound lead by *at least* several hundred thousand / maybe a million votes. Long Island in some parts leans conservative (on/around 50:50 , or 45/55 in some directions), but really discounting the small cities in Upstate NY, the rest of the state is conservative.

I wonder how Lee can campaign &amp; bring prosperity to NY, it may involve toning down his politics a notch, and most likely the big challenge would be some of his critics / uncommitted voters harping on Lee Zeldin’s relationship to Donald Trump. I also think this may mean that once the campaign picks up steam next year, this could mean he cannot simultaneously run for re-election for NY-1 (or whenever his new CD would be, pending reapportionment) in Long Island. The race could be a “all or nothing” gamble. I personally think he does have a bit more credibility to run rather than Andrew Giuliani, regardless of his father’s reputation.

Whether it’s a new Republican or Democratic challengers, we can all agree Cuomo’s politically weakened, this is the perfect time for a political rival of Governor Cuomo to rise &amp; challenge him next year. It’s still uncertain who would primary him for the Democratic nomination, since his political support is weakening.

"Everything you just said is A) either unrelated to what I just said, or B) a shitty excuse

I don’t care if you’re McCarthy or one of the fucks trying to get people fired from their jobs for doing something they don’t like. It’s toxic as fuck and damaging to our society. 

As for the guns comment, there is yet again a threat of executive action coming on guns. There is no loophole in background checks. It was not an oversight, it was a compromise when the law was written, private sales are none of the governments business. As for the dems coming to get guns, that’s a multi step process. The first step is to get a list of all the fucks who own each gun. Short of that it’s going to be step by step, inch by inch concessions by lawful gun owners until there’s nothing left. The 94-04 ban did nothing to help the situation as ar-15s and all other rifle platforms are responsible for fewer than 400 deaths per year. What’s next after that doesn’t work.

"Here is the hot take and the truth. Republicans know that Black people commit more violent crime. This lowers the bar in the individuals mind for what constitutes self defense and makes them more likely to react violently. So, more black people will kill more black people. The left knows that this will increase violent crime, it is a fundamental fact of stats that states that pass stand your ground laws do see an increase in violent crime. 

While yes, the idea of a white person shooting a black person is there and getting away with it because the narative is one sided, the same holds true for literally all colors of all races. But this is the only argument that the left can use because they can't say that this will lead to black people shooting each other more. The right knows that this will lead to more gun violence amongst black people so they get the win-win of black people killing each other more, catering to their white 2nd amendment worshipers, and being able to tout the factual statement that black people commit more violent crimes than other races.

He's all of the worst parts of Trump and none of the good parts.  He will EAGERLY sell out every last Republican and not lose a wink of sleep if it gets him what he wants.

I'm not sure why everyone suddenly likes him and why everyone is talking about a presidency, but he is toxic.  He started out good but then he realized he could garner support by just saying aggressive statements.

"I support to the extent that we understand the limitations of it and the consequences of what we are doing.

- Use it as a transient fuel, not as long term solution. Not until someone can come up with a way to deal with nuclear waste, dumping it somewhere remote isn't 'dealing' with it. I'd say that somewhere between 30-80 years should be enough depending on how fast we develop other sources of renewable energy.

- Neither the waste disposal, nor the plant's operation should involve private sector, or at the very least is heavily regulated at the federal level 1. Nuclear fuel can be used to create nuclear bombs , it's not something that should be handled lightly. 2. The risk of fallout from improper operation of nuclear reactor are massive, which means federal regulations and laws inspection at the very least, although best is to not involve private companies at all. 3. I can't trust private company not trying to make the disposal as cheap as it can and deal with a couple of lawsuits later if the cost benefit analysis supports that.

"Should have gone to college someplace in Florida...My take on it: 

For example, take the timeline for the earth's creation. Try having an open kind of conversation in a college geology class that approaches creation with any thing that supports biblical creation...that doesn't go well.  Not saying the science is wrong, just questioning it when there are other academic cases that could be made or explanations...nope they don't care about those sources you research and find IN THE COLLEGE LIBRARY, just buy the $300 text book and regurgitate their facts like some of the common ones: carbon dating (like nothing could speed up or even slow down this process we don't know about?) and dendrochonlogy (like God couldn't put more rings in a tree if he wanted to?)....Give up you can't win vs academics. So spend 4 years regurgitating their facts so you can get a degree and get a decent paying job, support you're family, and try to live righteously.

 But nope the same folks making money off the tuition and textbooks brain wash people to vilify the petroleum industry (kill jobs) with their ""facts"" about climate change... Ive got an inconvenient truth for you, the degree you paid for is more and more worthless, but they still are admitting students to pay them for it (if it was so bad to drill oil why would they help folks get degrees to do it= $$$), and they still find your number to make alumni calls and beg for more money.

Most of academia is full of sheep...fact is they just follow each other's work and add little bits and pieces to it ""peer review"" means all the sheep agree..  like sheep, they need to be open to a Shepard leading them.

 Im tired of academic scientists owning ""science"".

Kind of hard to have definitive proof when they keep all the hard evidence hidden, don't allow cameras and kick out the observers. Innocent people don't try to hide things though, they want transparency to prove their innocence and make their accusers look bad.

So the evidence is the censorship, fighting against audits, etc. They could have just pulled up the logs and ballot images from Georgia to debunk it all but they didn't, that's the proof. Trump asked who the votes went for, SoS had nothing to say.

"For a news program that has been airing for over 50 years and has done tens of thousands of pieces of investigative journalism? More than 3, I’d say.

How about one bad/controversial 60 minutes story for every award 60 minutes has won:

That’s 138 emmy’s alone. You have 138 pieces of bad reporting to link me?

But I guess the judges are liberals so their thoughts and opinions don’t matter, no matter how educated they are in broadcast journalism.

Now, Fox News on the other hand... there is a news organization with a sterling reputation and a vigorous dedication to “just the facts”... that push a conservative agenda.

Fox News has won zero emmys, but it did get its first nomination in 2019 for Chris Wallace’s interview with Putin.

Additionally, your insurance now has no lifetime cap, so if you get cancer you won't eventually have to sell everything you own and go destitute to end up on Medicaid.

It's not perfect, but that's what happens when Republicans came up with the plan in the first place and then refused to allow the bill to go to a vote. It was a compromise with a party who forgot the meaning of the word.

They do what they always do, what would you like to drink spiel, we have coke products. What would you like. I actually did say that.

They like nice tips. which, of course they got. The food was good and the drop in our soda consumption has been good for us.


Boycotting something is a fairly basic way to get to who will care. The manufacturers bottom line.  Less consumption equals less revenue.  The spread of that? It's called area of effect.

Let me educate you on how large corps and the rich pay taxes. There's loopholes designed just for them and has been for decades.

The tax code stays consistent for 10 years which it also never has in that time period. Now Biden is extremely old and was in congress for over 40 years, in that time did he ever vote for a balanced budget? Nope. Did he vote for every increase in federal spending? Yup. You still didn't answer how the Biden 1.9 T Covid stimulus was paid for but we both know it was merely printed and thrown on the heap that is our deficit with no regard for the future consequences.

"Your study is from 2012. What do you think a contemporary study would show, given Trump supporters proclivities for conspiracy theories, trolling, and insurrection? I could link you an article how far right the Republican Party has drifted from center (and reality) under Trump.

Also, you didn’t just link the study. You linked a website with an obvious partisan axe to grind trying to frame the study as saying things it really didn’t.

From PEW:

""Differences in news knowledge across partisan groups are relatively modest, though Republicans tend to do somewhat better than Democrats overall.  Republicans are 16 points more likely than Democrats to answer the Common Core question correctly (58% vs. 42%).  And 57% of Republicans identify the oil industry as a primary driver of growth in North Dakota, compared with 42% of Democrats.  On other issues, such as the unemployment rate, there are hardly any differences in news knowledge between Republicans and Democrats.  Just 38% of Republicans and 34% of Democrats know that the unemployment rate is currently closest to 6%.  Many Americans overestimate the current unemployment rate:  27% say it is closest to 9%, while an additional 18% think the rate is closest to 12%."" 

If I have any critique of the study, I would say that 12 random questions from the unemployment rate to wars in the Middle East don’t encompass the whole of political knowledge possible in the United States, would you agree? A respondent may not know what country the U.S. most recently bombed, but perhaps they are experts in the advantages of universal healthcare. According to this study, that asked no such question about contemporary issues because it’s nearly a decade old, said expert in health policy would be less informed than a tea partied while watches lots of Bill O Reilly. But is that tea party member really more informed or just differently informed?

But like I said, 10 years out of date. No longer applicable to our current political climate.

That article isn’t completely accurate. The pedals were shifted slightly to the left compared to most cars but had nothing to do with it being European. It had to do with it being all wheel drive. The transmission tunnel was slightly wider which necessitated relocating the pedals. When the Jeep Grand Cherokee came out in the 1990s there were claims of unintended acceleration with it too. Of course Jeep offers 4 wheel drive/all wheel drive. I remember reading a magazine article where they measured the offset of the pedals from the center of the steering column. The Audi 5000 and Jeep (ZJ) Grand Cherokee had almost identical offsets. So it was indeed driver error.,1617853758.0,gtrrdlu,t3_mmhgav,/r/Conservative/comments/mmhgav/til_of_that_one_time_60_minutes_faked_a_defect_in/gtrrdlu/,2.0,1617868158.0,"article, pedals, left, cars, wheel, drive, transmission, tunnel, t3_mmhgav, 1990s, claims, acceleration, magazine, offset, center, steering, column, offsets, driver, error",0.3566666666666667,0.15666666666666668,0.0

"Maybe the case isn’t as clear cut as it seems. Maybe more information will still come out?

Or maybe it’s just 60 minutes best legal position not to buy into the conservative characterization of their intentions. Conservatives love to jump into wild conspiracy theories... it’s their tv show bread and butter. What if 60 minutes made an honest mistake? Why must their intentions be sinister by default? Why is it naive to believe not everything is a conspiracy, and not every person/organization operates in bad faith pushing a political agenda.

I remember a time before Trump where Democrats and Republicans could still debate solutions to our problems in good faith. I know that time seems like it was decades ago (because it was), but it definitely happened. I used to be able to debate my Republican father and ask him for his opinions on issues when I was in high school. I didn’t always agree, but he often had more convincing arguments than my democratic mother.

My father is in his 70s, but his convictions are mostly the same. Small government, strong military, low taxes, and prudent use of the taxes that are collected. Guess who he didn’t vote for in 2016 or 2020, despite being a Republican, because he knew Trump didn’t really stand for any of those things, save for lower taxes, but it wasn’t worth the trade off of having an ignorant, foolish, embarrassment for a commander in chief.",1617853342.0,gtrqow2,t1_gtpnod6,/r/Conservative/comments/mm3fm1/what_a_disaster_emails_between_60_minutes_and_ron/gtrqow2/,0.0,1617867742.0,"case, cut, information, minutes, position, characterization, intentions, Conservatives, conspiracy, theories, tv, show, bread, butter, mistake, default, person, organization, faith, agenda, time, t1_gtpnod6, solutions, problems, decades, father, opinions, issues, school, arguments, mother, 70s, convictions, government, taxes, use, things, trade, embarrassment, commander, chief",0.4909333333333333,0.19773333333333337,0.0

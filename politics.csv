"Nope, but that sort of 'holy war' thinking as Manchin calls it is part of the problem.  Neolibs are just the current leadership of the Democratic Party, the Party existed before them, it will exist after them. Ditto for the neocons and the GOP.

As far as neo-political strategy, its just pathways. The neolibs sought their path through idealized federalism which was an interesting experiment but has never overcome the Constitutional structure/function of the state. Neolibs just didn't change enough hearts/minds in the time period they had to complete this experiment. 

As far as the neocons, they are dying as a political power.

""The new Georgia law shortens the window of time in which voters can request their mail-in ballots; that window will now close two Fridays before Election Day"" which I think was how it was 'pre covid'

""The Georgia law also left intact the state’s no-excuse absentee voting rules, meaning anyone, regardless of their ability to vote in person, can request a mail-in ballot.""

""Voters now need to list their driver’s license or state ID number on their application for an absentee ballot, and election workers will use that to verify ballots in lieu of signature matching, which critics say is much more subjective.
If a Georgia voter has no ID, they can list the last four digits of their Social Security number instead.""

&amp;#x200B;

[While on the active CDC website I do not see any mention of their own study they do still post findings of much higher defensive use than offensive uses of firearms.](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/firearms/fastfact.html)  

from the referenced data source article

&gt; *In 1996, 1997, and 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted large-scale national surveys asking about defensive gun use (DGU). They never released the findings, or even acknowledged they had studied the topic. I obtained the unpublished raw data and computed the prevalence of DGU. CDC’s findings indicated that an average of 2.46 million U.S. adults used a gun for self-defense in each of the years from 1996 through 1998 – almost exactly confirming the estimate for 1992 of Kleck and Gertz (1995). Possible reasons for CDC’s suppression of these findings are discussed.* 

&amp;#x200B;

from the CDC website currently: 

&gt; Estimates of defensive gun use vary depending on the questions asked, populations studied, timeframe, and other factors related to the design of studies. The report [*Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence*external icon](http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2013/Priorities-for-Research-to-Reduce-the-Threat-of-Firearm-Related-Violence.aspx) indicates a range of 60,000 to 2.5 million defensive gun uses each year.

"I know I know... “both sides” and what not, but when I was looking at the donation requests from left wing aligned groups (after giving money), the emails I got were ridiculously hyperbolic.

Other than the regional parties (SNP, DUP, etc...) that have a more or less established voter base that's localized enough to win seats, it's very hard for smaller parties to gain seats. In the most recent general election (2019), the largest third party in votes, the Liberal Democrats, got 11% of the votes, but just 1.7% of the seats. More extreme examples exist, such as the 2015 election where UKIP scored 12.6% of the votes and won just a single seat (out of 650).

The multi-party system in the UK is barely holding on, mostly thanks to the large number of constituencies and strong regional parties. But when was the last time a party other than the Conservatives or Labour led a government (potentially with a small party tagging along for the ride)?",1617999830.0,gtyyubu,t1_gtyfq9r,/r/politics/comments/mngsvn/gop_goes_full_psychopath_threatens_to_tell_trump/gtyyubu/,1.0,1618014230.0,"t1_gtyfq9r, representatives, constituencies, districts, parties, constituency, bit, people, district, times, voter, base, seats, election, party, votes, %, examples, seat, system, thanks, number, time, government, tagging, ride",0.43716736694677866,0.05603991596638654,0.0

"“Video of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and a panel of scientists apparently trading in Covid-19 misinformation has been pulled from YouTube.

The video of DeSantis’ roundtable discussion last month at the state Capitol in Tallahassee was removed on Wednesday because it violated the social media platform’s standards, YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez said.

It had been embedded in a Tampa-area TV station's news story and it's removal was flagged by the American Institute for Economic Research, a ""free market"" think tank based in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.

“YouTube has clear policies around Covid-19 medical misinformation to support the health and safety of our users,” Hernandez said in a statement. “We removed AIER’s video because it included content that contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19.”

Hernandez said YouTube only allows videos “that otherwise violate our policies to remain on the platform if they contain sufficient educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context.”

“Our policies apply to everyone and focus on content regardless of the speaker or channel,” Hernandez said.

DeSantis's press secretary Cody McCloud called YouTube's move ""another blatant example of Big Tech attempting to silence those who disagree with their woke corporate agenda.""

""YouTube claimed they removed the video because 'it contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities,' yet this roundtable was led by world-renowned doctors and epidemiologists from Oxford, Stanford, and Harvard, all of whom are eminently qualified to speak on the global health crisis,"" McCloud said. ""Good public health policy should include a variety of scientific and technical expertise, and YouTube’s decision to remove this video suppresses productive dialogue of these complex issues.""

Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University, one of the scientists on the panel, said this ""was a policy forum, in which it is appropriate to consider both the benefits and costs of a policy (child masking) when making judgments and recommendations.""

""YouTube’s censorship of our discussion is contrary to American democratic norms of free expression,"" the professor said in an email. ""It is also a violation of basic standards of scientific conduct, which stand in opposition to unreasoned silencing of contrary views and require the free exchange of ideas.""

Earlier, AIER editorial director Jeffrey A. Tucker insisted in an article Wednesday on the think tank’s website that YouTube censored DeSantis and the scientists and called it “the latest attack on public health information.”

Many public health experts, however, have accused Bhattacharya and the other scientists on the panel with DeSantis — former Trump White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Scott Atlas; epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta; and Dr. Martin Kulldorff — of spreading public health misinformation. NBC News has also reached out to Tucker, Atlas, Gupta and Kulldorff for comment.

NBC News did not see the video before it was removed. Tucker first reported its removal.

But based on a transcript provided by YouTube, it appears the participants ran afoul of the platform’s standards when DeSantis asked whether children in school should be wearing masks and Kulldorff replied, “Uh, children should not wear face masks, no. They don’t need it for their own protection, and they don’t need it for protecting other people either.”

Less than a minute later, Bhattacharya chimed-in, saying that mask-wearing “is developmentally inappropriate and it just doesn’t help on the disease spread.”

“There’s no scientific rationale or logic to have children wear masks in school,” Atlas said six minutes later.

That language also appears in the transcript posted by Tucker with his article.

Those claims run counter to the recommendations of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which advises that “people age 2 and older should wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household.”

The World Health Organization recommendations are a bit looser for younger children, but kids age 12 and over “should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults.”

All the scientists in the video but Atlas are signatories to The Great Barrington Declaration, which was sponsored by AIER and which opposed lockdowns and argued that society would build herd immunity against Covid-19 if all but people over age 70 “resume life as normal.”

Atlas, who is a radiologist, not an epidemiologist, was especially critical of mask wearing to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Many of the world’s leading scientists denounced The Great Barrington Declaration as a “dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence.” And later, then-President Donald Trump’s CDC chief, Dr. Robert Redfield, was overhead by NBC saying of Atlas, “Everything he says is false.”

The Trump administration embraced that thinking, as did DeSantis, who was criticized by public health experts for being slow to shut the state down and for reopening the state too soon. Most of the Covid-19 deaths and cases were recorded in Florida after DeSantis visited Trump in the White House last April and prematurely, as it turned out, declared victory over the virus.

As of Friday, Florida had reported more than 2 million Covid-19 infections and nearly 35,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to the latest NBC News numbers. It also has the tenth highest Covid-19 infection rate in the country, according to Becker’s Hospital Review.

DeSantis in the AIER transcript agreed with his panelists that lockdowns were ineffective at stopping the pandemic, saying ""there’s really not a lot of positive to balance it out when you compare the severe lockdown states to other states which weren’t locked down or other countries like Sweden, which had adopted a different approach.""

Sweden initially opposed lockdowns but began imposing restrictions about six months ago after the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths soared, especially in comparison with its Scandinavian neighbors.”",1617999673.0,gtyyi5h,t3_mnpbzq,/r/politics/comments/mnpbzq/youtube_pulls_florida_governors_video_says_his/gtyyi5h/,1.0,1618014073.0,"t3_mnpbzq, panel, scientists, misinformation, video, discussion, month, state, media, platform, standards, spokesperson, area, TV, station, news, story, removal, market, tank, policies, health, safety, users, statement, content, consensus, authorities, efficacy, masks, spread, videos, documentary, context, speaker, channel, press, secretary, move, example, agenda, world, doctors, epidemiologists, crisis, policy, variety, expertise, decision, dialogue, issues, forum, benefits, costs, child, masking, judgments, recommendations, censorship, norms, expression, professor, email, violation, conduct, opposition, silencing, views, exchange, ideas, editorial, director, article, think, website, attack, information, experts, coronavirus, advisor, comment, transcript, participants, children, school, face, protection, people, minute, mask, disease, rationale, logic, minutes, language, claims, settings, household, bit, kids, age, conditions, adults, signatories, lockdowns, society, herd, immunity, life, radiologist, epidemiologist, fallacy, evidence, chief, administration, thinking, deaths, cases, victory, virus, infections, start, pandemic, numbers, infection, rate, country, AIER, panelists, lot, lockdown, states, countries, approach, restrictions, months, number, comparison, neighbors",0.3438653198653198,0.09625589225589226,0.0

The post-WWII German constitution included the creation of a government institution that monitors anti-democratic activities. Publicly advocating against the democratic constitution is a crime, it's one of the limits of free speech in Germany.

Sure, for Americans who value the First Amendment above everything, this would appear to be oppressive government overreach, but then again ... there's Nazis on the other side. 

Germany had to dig itself out of the rubble created by an authoritarian populist demagogue once, and doesn't want to do that again anytime soon.

Regulations on guns federally: 

Cannot sell a pistol to anyone under 21

Any and all commercial sales, including those at gun shows, require background checks

All machine guns and firearms easily converted to full-auto are illegal unless they were manufactured and registered prior to 1986

All suppressors must be registered and have an extra $200 tax, require months long background check. If you intend to take the item out of state, you must make the ATF aware. If you move houses you must make the ATF aware. 

All rifles with barrels less than 16” must be registered and have an extra $200 tax, require months long background check. If you intend to take the item out of state, you must make the ATF aware. If you move houses you must make the ATF aware. 

Same for short barreled shotguns and anything explosive. 

If you live with anyone who did not pay the same tax and get the same background check at the same time you did, they cannot have access to any items previously mentioned. 

You cannot sell a pistol to someone out-of-state, or if you do it must be shipped to a gun store in their home state and the purchaser has to get the BCG done in their home state. This also stands for private sales

Multitudes of import bans for weapons and ammo for no reason other than to reduce the availability of common-use firearms to civilians

"The amount of disrespect I’ve read about the “idiots” who voted against unionizing is more depressing than the actual results of the vote. It’s wild to me that people who have never been in a union can’t possible fathom that not all unions are the godsend that Reddit/Twitter make it seem. Last week it was “Amazon exploits poor workers,” this week it’s “what a bunch of fucking republican morons.”

How about instead of vilifying every fucking thing you don’t understand or goes against what you think should happen, you try and gauge the actual pros and cons of the decisions people make with a little context. Try putting yourselves in their shoes for 2 seconds.

Bessemer is city that has been decimated by a declining economy (mining and manufacturing) and growing unemployment for decades. Then Amazon comes in and creates 5000 jobs with benefits and pays double what most people in that city were making. Not to mention all the bureaucracy, dues and extra work that come with managing a union. Add on to that the fact that Amazon could easily shut down the warehouse and boom the city goes back to being crap overnight. With these factors you can start to see why someone would want to vote no.

Then Amazon comes in and creates 5000 jobs with benefits and pays double what most people in that city were making. Not to mention all the bureaucracy, dues and extra work that come with managing a union.

"I cannot support expanding the court.

* I do like the stability of the judicial branch. Expanding the court opens up a precedent where the next Republican administration will almost definitely do the same. 

* I am not unhappy (though not particularly happy either) with the present composition of the Court. I was unhappy about the nominations of Barrett and Kavanaugh, but they are, indeed, legitimate justices appointed by a legitimate (but bad) president and confirmed by a legitimately elected Senate. I cannot agree with stripping their legitimately confirmed seats, as some have suggested. Their rulings on some cases (such as the election cases and the Trump tax return cases) have been particularly satisfactory.

* I have observed a tendency of the Supreme Court to center itself whenever it gets too extreme. Roberts and Kennedy have shown tendencies to move to the left. Gorsuch, similarly, have shown the same tendency.

"&gt;Sounds like a convenient way to stall progress.

On the contrary, an up-front assault weapons ban will stall progress. Any legislation being passed should prioritize the *worst* source of gun violence and work its way down. That's not going to happen here. They're going to pass an AWB, pat themselves on the back, and say ""There we go! We took steps to end gun violence. Yay for us!"" and then when the statistics barely move, they'll shrug and say ""We did the AWB like you asked! What else do you want?"" Meanwhile, the anti-gun control crowd will say ""See? You spent millions passing and enforcing an AWB and gun crime didn't shift! This is why gun control laws are a waste of time!"" Political strength will shift, conservatives will eventually overturn the AWB, and then it'll be *even harder next time* to get one passed. 

The fact that an AWB won't put a meaningful dent in the statistics will itself be used as a weapon against gun control.

&gt;The NRA argued against the original assault weapons bans by saying they were used in only a small number of total crimes, as if you can only address a problem if it’s big enough of the overall pie landscape of crime. 

Yeah, and did you notice how the NRA *did not* pivot that argument into a push for more handgun legislation? They don't care about gun violence, they're just spewing bullshit to discredit gun control. I'm in favor of gun control, I just think it needs to apply to the main source of gun death in the country.

&gt;To handguns specifically - why can’t we do both? Why is your response “yes, but” and not “yes, and”?

It is 'yes, and'. I'm arguing in favor of both, but my concern is that placing too much focus on ""assault weapons"" is going to muddy the issue and ultimately people are going to lose focus on what's responsible for over 10,000 deaths per year in the US.

"Sure. I would seriously implore you to look into the history of gun registration and confiscation. The important thing to note: when you buy a gun in a free state, there is a simple background check, but no registration database (like in CA, for example). If you ask people that build homemade guns (in every state) to register them with the state, you are de facto creating a registry where none previously existed, which is even more problematic in places that don't have registration (like your state). The people building these legally would already pass a background check. It's already illegal to build guns if you are a prohibited person, so why would we make it double illegal to possess an 80% receiver- it's literally a useless chunk of metal until a human machines it to completion. This proposed legislation makes zero sense, and brutally inflicts on your civil liberties, especially for someone like you that lives in a free state with no current gun registry. Look at banning of braces, for example. Biden says we need to do this so they aren't ""concealable"". But if you remove the brace, the gun literally becomes smaller, not bigger.

"Being a creationist is non-falsifiable. I don't support it, but you can't disprove the central premise: An entity, through methods we do not understand, created the Universe. 

Since such creation would happen outside of the Universe, any evidence for or against the hypothesis would not be accessible within the Universe. I personally don't choose to support the hypothesis due to its inability to be tested, but I can understand and accept someone who chooses to accept it.

With YE creationism, however, you do start getting into claims that can be falsified. The world was demonstrably not created 6,000 years ago. We have evidence, corroborated on a massive scale, that the Earth itself is over 4 billion years old, and that it is fairly young on the cosmic scale. That evidence could be wrong, of course, but such a massive amount of scientific knowledge would then be invalidated that your evidence would have to be gob-smackingly overwhelming while *also* matching with all the rest of scientific knowledge. The chance of that is so astonishingly low as to be justified in dismissing YE creationism. 

Short version (too late, I know): Both creationist hypotheses lack supporting evidence, but simple creationism (God created the universe) does not *contradict* existing evidence. There's no reason to believe it, but no reason not to believe it either.

"&gt;What's there to say?

I mean you made a lot of good points. There's an argument to me made that all people should be able to vote after the age of 18. The previous person just stated an opinion without an argument. 

Laws are tricky because they are changing all the time and we constantly recognize previous laws of not just being poorly constructed, but actually immoral or vindictive. Drugs laws and laws around homosexuality are perfect examples of how laws can be designed to disenfranchise certain people. 

But we could also say that not every crime is an infraction of a flawed law. I don't want to be simplistic, but certain types of murder would probably be an example of a crime that has little excuse. And though there is plenty of room to disagree, I don't think it's extreme to say that something like that results in the loss of your vote for a period of time. When someone breaks the contract and harms society, maybe they lose the right to participate on that level.

"So, the Republican Party, even starting with Lincoln, was pro-business, just not capitalists. Lincoln was a ""Clay Man"" so he would have pushed something like the American System. Central Bank, Investment in Infrastructure, High Tariffs, Strong Federal Government. 

Both parties were pro-business in the 19th Century. The GOP, however, still resembled The Party of Lincoln. It wasn't until the New Deal you started seeing more Conservative elements take root in the West and Midwest, and by the 1960s the Southern Strategy saw these conservatives really finding a home in the Republican Party.

The thing that is kind of unique today is the unified front of the parties. Factions and infighting seemed more common decades ago than it does now. 

My point about conservatism changing is really in reference to the shift starting with those conservatives from the West/Midwest to the present. To me, the shift in what is believed to be ""conservative"" is really interesting. States' Rights and laissez-faire capitalism would have been a radical position in the 1790s, and big government a conservative one. 

I think it is unfortunate. As a left leaning independent I do think there are times to be cautious (conservative with a lowercase 'c') about the adoption of new policy and making sure we don't put the cart before the horse.

"I disagree with expanding the Court. A few reasons:
* I lean left but I do not consider myself a member of the ""radical left."" I agree with some conservative policies, such as maintaining the death penalty and tightening some drug policies.
* Stability in the judicial system, without unduly influence by the current politics of the country, sounds like a good idea.
* I have seen the Court automatically balancing itself throughout the last few years. Roberts is moving to the left. Gorsuch appears to be moving to the left. Some decisions have been unanimous. Many decisions have at least both sides joining in.

I was happy with a 5-4 conservative court. I am a bit less happy about a 6-3 conservative court. But I do not consider it nearly necessary to change the structure of the Court.

Sure, I didn't approve of Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett's appointments. But they are appointed and confirmed in a way the Constitution prescribes (nominated by a legitimate President as certified by the 2017 congress, confirmed by the Senate according to the Senate Rules). I am unhappy about their confirmations, but they are legitimate justices, in the same way Trump was a legitimate (but bad) president.

"You're right, that is very different - the headlines were only suggesting that he helped back a candidate who pulled votes across, but didn't really talk about *how*, and I should have read up on it more before asking - yeah using a fake name and someone who will drop out if they win is very different to just backing a bad additional real person on the opponents side, absolutely.

As for why it's being brought up? Yeah it's not related to Matt Gaetz directly, but it helps inform whether it's a problem with a specific group of people in american politics, or a problem with american politics as a whole. I'm in the UK so I don't get a very complete picture of how your systems work over there and what's going on, so when I see people freaking out over headlines like these, my automatic reaction is ""isn't this old news? isn't this just how your system works over there and has for decades?"", which was obviously wrong in this case.

"&gt; Some things are worth half a century of effort. **Fred Wertheimer** has been campaigning for good government and against corruption in Washington since 1971. That year he joined a new organization called Common Cause, founded by John Gardner and dedicated to getting big money out of politics and empowering Americans to participate in the democratic system. In 1974, during the Watergate scandal (which was partly about the corruption of politics by secret money), Wertheimer and Common Cause successfully pushed Congress to pass legislation that created public financing of presidential elections, limited campaign contributions, and established the Federal Election Commission. Two years later, in Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court ruled that money is speech and reversed some of the law’s spending limits. Decades passed. The bilgewater kept rising. In 2002, as president of Democracy 21—a nonprofit he’d founded in 1997—Wertheimer was instrumental in the passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, known as McCain-Feingold, which banned “soft money” contributions to political parties by corporations and unions.

"Yes, lifetime service seems to be required by the Constitution.

That said, we have no reason to set the number of justices at a fixed number.  Term limits is partly focused on the idea that we need fresh people regularly appointed to the court.  But we could just address that directly without needing to squint so hard at the rules.

Just allow one supreme court appointment at the start of every Presidential term.  Congress gets to set the number in law, but nothing says that number has to be a permanent number.  It can increase every inauguration day by law without touching the Constitution.  Set a minimum court size of like 5 justices so if everybody keels over at once, the President in office at the time may get multiple appointments.  Aside from that, just ignore when a justice dies as long as it's above five.  The number of seats reduces when somebody leaves.  The number goes back up next inauguration day.  The number of justices might vary between five and 20 or so depending on how long the justices live, but that doesn't hurt anything.  There are already rules about what happens with a tie, etc., so it's not like we have a hard requirement for an odd number of justices.

"I see you ignored my follow up response just below.  Alright, let's work with your EXACT scenario. ;)

This [article](https://www.postguam.com/the_globe/nation/child-said-he-was-going-to-watch-cartoons-instead-he-opened-his-dads-gun-safe/article_77f40b82-934e-11eb-8bbd-9f01121e4376.html), originally from the Washington Post, details a typical story of child finding dad's gun, and accidentally killing himself.  Now it should be noted, the father did have the gun locked in a safe.  The issue was that his son knew where the key was.  In the safe was a loaded pistol.  

Anyways, the exact scenario you describe, a depressed gun owner not seeking help because he's afraid people will take his guns could've been applied to this scenario.  The funny thing is, the father's brother did go to his house to take his guns.  The article points out that the father, while stating he has no intention to harm himself, is not sure he believes his own statement.  In that moment he agrees to let his brother take every gun.

While grief and depression are similar, they're different monsters categorically.  The point I'm driving home is that this man, prior to his son's death, was a responsible gun owner.  Within the 24 hours of his son dying, he was not sure if he could trust himself with his guns.  

So to address your point.  I see nothing wrong with a gun owner losing their weapons while getting help.  The human mind is capable of amazing and insane things.  For now, red flag gun laws will stop the sale of a weapon to a person who repeatedly is screaming to kill Nancy Pelosi on social media or has been flashing his dick in public places because he believes it wards of 4th dimensional beings.",1617995699.0,gtypwwn,t1_gtw894b,/r/politics/comments/mmwqq4/megathread_president_joseph_biden_announces/gtypwwn/,1.0,1618010099.0,"follow, response, t1_gtw894b, scenario, the_globe, nation, child, watch, cartoons, dads, gun, article_77f40b82, details, story, dad, father, safe, issue, son, key, pistol, owner, help, people, guns, thing, brother, house, article, intention, statement, moment, grief, depression, monsters, point, man, death, hours, weapons, mind, things, flag, laws, sale, weapon, person, media, dick, places, wards, beings",0.561965811965812,0.01698717948717949,0.0

"&gt; I live in a pretty open state for gun laws and I've never had a reason to get an nonserialized firearm.

Oh, no! Please don't use the ""need to have"" argument next. Just because you don't have a reason for something, doesn't mean someone else doesn't. Also, the constitution doesn't care about your ""needs"", it protects mine. You are projecting again. Check out jpfo dot org, or any history book that details the actions of brutal genocidal dictators. They like to use registration records to confiscate firearms. That's why we have historically always allowed legal home builders to make unserialized firearms in the first place. Regarding 2A, I would quote George Mason: ""I ask, sir, what is the militia? It is the whole people except for a few public officials."" Try reading the Federalist Papers for a full understanding of what 2A means. You are not correct about SCOTUS. A few points: historically, private citizens have owned such ""weapons"" as warships equipped with dozens of cannons. This would put the interpretation of Heller v. D.C. as more restrictive, as it essentially ruled that only weapons you can actually ""bare"" (and in common use) would be protected by 2A. This is a violation of precedent, based on previously mentioned warship ownership. Presser v. Illinois established 2A as an individual right, not required to be connected to a militia. US v. Miller is hilarious, as it essentially said that private citizens can only own military weapons, which flies in the face of those that want to ban ""weapons of war"".",1617995471.0,gtypf7d,t1_gtyn1mi,/r/politics/comments/mmwqq4/megathread_president_joseph_biden_announces/gtypf7d/,1.0,1618009871.0,"gt, state, gun, laws, reason, firearm, need, argument, constitution, needs, jpfo, dot, org, history, book, actions, dictators, registration, records, firearms, home, builders, place, 2A, t1_gtyn1mi, sir, militia, people, officials, understanding, points, citizens, weapons, warships, dozens, cannons, interpretation, use, 2A., violation, precedent, warship, ownership, right, face, war",0.4529960317460317,0.03893037518037518,0.0

"I'll grant you, this is a more nuanced take than what you said in the OP. You seemed to claim that liberals somehow changed the definition of the term, which they didn't really, but they do certainly try to tie white supremacy to more things these days. I think most of the time they are correct, but I can understand how a conservative who does not subscribe to supremacy would get frustrated by the implication. 

I think what is really needed is an understanding of what liberals are actually trying to call out. For immigration, a lot of attention is paid to illegal border crossings, while like 90+% of illegal immigrants are actually on visa overstays. The image of foreign invaders is an effective tactic to motivate right-leaning voters. It paints them as evil invaders bent on undoing ""western civilization"", not poor and deprived children and refugees. If the right cared about making legal immigration better and reducing illegal immigration, they would be expanding immigration courts, not building a wall. Legal immigration was at a long-time low under Trump, not just illegal.

For voter ID, no one would complain if everyone just got a free government ID. That would completely make it a moot point. Republicans oppose standard free ID, so the requirement to use a driver's license is essentially a surcharge to vote, which many people can't afford for various reasons. Coincidentally (or not) the voters most likely to have issues procuring an ID are... you guessed it, overwhelmingly minority and/or poor. So yet again, the right maintains a shield of plausible deniability while passings all sorts of laws to remove the voters they choose. Another example, in some states you can vote with a gun license, but not a student ID. Hmm....

"&gt;Criminals don't obey the law. So any law you pass will invariably impact those that obey the law, but won't impact the criminal.

I legitimately can't tell if you are talking about gun control or trying to make some general argument. Laws impact criminals all the damn time. In fact they're how we *define* criminals...people who break the law. They are how we punish criminals. Of course these laws will impact criminals.

&gt;You can already arrest a criminal in the act using ANY gun.

If our aim is to reduce violence (which it is), then we need to prevent the criminal acts *before* they take place. Arresting a criminal in the act of executing a mass shooting doesn't prevent the mass shooting. Arresting them beforehand for possessing an unregistered firearm does. And some of us in this country think there are a few too many mass shootings.

&gt;This law will most impact a hobby of personally building legal guns

So get them serialized. I'm sorry, this ""impact"" seems pretty minimally invasive unless you're the sort of person that specifically wants their firearms off of the grid, in which case you probably correlate pretty highly with someone that a lot of us think shouldn't have one.

"Not actually ridiculous, at least in Canada.  With very few exceptions the rules have only gotten more strict over the last few decades, never less.  The previous Conservative government loosened up a few restrictions but that has since been cranked back up (plus a bunch more restrictions added) by the current government.

Back in 1989 there was a mass shooting in Montreal, and a group was formed to lobby for increased restrictions on firearms.  This led to a total revamping of the whole legal framework around firearms ownership and licensing (the current Firearms Act) but the group wasn't satisfied and is constantly lobbying for ever-stricter restrictions and most of our political parties are happy to go along with it even though it's not supported by statistics.

Just as an example, last year they utterly banned AR-15s in Canada even though nobody in Canada has ever been killed by a legally-owned AR-15.

"Let me fact check you. The person who authored the bill in [Arizona](https://youtu.be/McdxwyqPJIE) even admitted he couldn't even find an instance in his state of a trans female taking advantage or barring any cis gendered girls from playing in sports. His own assertion shows heis idea is trash.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When questioned on the matter, ***Ellington admitted there hadn't been any complaints received in West Virginia regarding a student ""taking advantage"" of the state's single-sex sports system,*** but claimed it had become an issue in other states around the country.

Here is an excerpt from a post I already submitted:

&gt;In reality, this putative problem does not exist. There is simply no evidence that transgender women are dominating student sports and denying cisgender women the benefits that come with athletic excellence, like scholarships. *Many states, including California, have long allowed trans athletes to participate alongside cisgender girls, and their policies have not diminished cisgender students’ ability to compete and win. ADF’s crusade against trans athletes has no basis in reality* [*or science*](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/18/978716732/wave-of-new-bills-say-trans-athletes-have-an-unfair-edge-what-does-the-science-s)*.* Major athletic bodies, including the NCAA, oppose them.

Dr. Eric Vilain has been researching trans athletes for the longest, and here is what he said in an interview with NPR:

&gt;We know that men have, on average, an advantage in performance in athletics of about 10% to 12% over women, which the sports authorities have attributed to differences in levels of a male hormone called testosterone. But the question is whether there is in real life, during actual competitions, an advantage of performance linked to this male hormone and whether trans athletes are systematically winning all competitions. *The answer to this latter question, are trans athletes winning everything, is simple — that's not the case*. And higher levels of the male hormone testosterone are associated with better performance only in a very small number of athletic disciplines: 400 meters, 800 meters, hammer throw, pole vault — and it certainly does not explain the whole 10% difference.

This is from Scientific American:

&gt;The notion of transgender girls having an unfair advantage [comes from the idea](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hormone-levels-are-being-used-to-discriminate-against-female-athletes/) that testosterone causes physical changes such as an increase in muscle mass. But transgender girls are not the only girls with high testosterone levels. An estimated 10 percent of women have polycystic ovarian syndrome, which results in elevated testosterone levels. They are not banned from female sports. Transgender girls on [puberty blockers](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-puberty-transgender/for-some-trans-youth-suicide-risk-lowers-with-puberty-suppression-idUSKBN1ZM311), on the other hand, have negligible testosterone levels. Yet these state bills would force them to play with the boys. Plus, the athletic advantage conferred by testosterone is [equivocal](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/06/testosterone-biological-sex-sports-bodies). As Katrina Karkazis, a senior visiting fellow and expert on testosterone and bioethics at Yale University explains, “Studies of testosterone levels in athletes do not show any clear, consistent relationship between testosterone and athletic performance. Sometimes testosterone is associated with better performance, but other studies show weak links or no links. And yet others show testosterone is associated with worse performance.” The bills’ premises lack scientific validity.

"Biden is not getting the second thing done. PA allows face to face sales of long guns with an FFL (handguns have to be transferred) and Biden does not have the power to change that.  I can see the argument for some semi-auto rifles to need background checks, but why should bolt guns and manual action shotguns require them?  They're not really concealable, they are not capable of rapid, accurate fire, and nearly all are low-capacity (5 rds or less).  If we are going to make people jump through extra hoops to exercise a right, there should at least be a broader benefit to it.

I might be what you consider a gun nut because I own a bunch of guns, but I'm also pretty far left &amp; live in the city, so I probably don't match many of your stereotypes about them.  I'm 100% opposed to ""may issue"" anything because it always turns into ""may issue to those with the right political connections"" (NYC) or ""may issue after unnecessary delays or complications"" (Philadelphia).  ""Shall issue"" just means that permits/licenses/etc. must be issued if the requirements are met, it doesn't mean they are issued to everyone.  I could possibly get on board with an objective, transparent set of criteria with a fair and defined appeals process, but no one is proposing that.

There is huge a reason for firearms licenses, carry permits, etc. that has nothing to do with carrying a concealed weapon out in public: transport. Federal, and in my case also state law, defines specific circumstances where guns are allowed to be possessed outside of home, e.g. to sell, repair, take to the range, etc. but those have to be the specific purpose of your trip. You can take your gun from home to your work on a farm and back, but you can't make any stops not directly related to the trip along the way.

In my case, I first bought a gun to have camping/hiking in remote areas of PA after years of occasional sketchy encounters with wildlife and people.  I can open carry around my campsite and on trails and stash my gun in my tent or car, but I can't legally get it there without a License to Carry Firearms since my trip doesn't qualify as one of the exceptions.  I have no interest in carrying a concealed gun out in public (even though I legally can), I only have a permit so I can transport my guns without legal worries and so I can carry concealed in my backpack when it in the wilderness (open carry understandably freaks people out).  It also means I can load all of the pistol magazines at home before going shooting and save a lot of time.

If laws allowed for reasonable people to have easy access to reasonable uses of firearms without fear of prosecution, fewer people would see the need for a concealed carry permit and more would accept greater restrictions on them.  A law that makes it automatically legal to have a gun in your car (unloaded and with ammo secured - the current standard) as long as it's for legal purposes, vs the current situation of needing to meet a certain exception, would mean a ton of people with current permits would no longer need them. Having different classes of concealed permits (e.g. one for carrying around crowds in public) would probably get quite a few people on board with more restrictions on some of them, especially if it meant easier or no permits for concealed carry in more rural areas.

Restricting access to licenses/permits just means it's harder for me and the rest of the gun owners to exercise legal rights without any clear benefit to society in general, so there is blanket opposition. A lot of gun owners are mouth-breathing idiots, but they are far from all of them. The reasonable ones are open to updating and improving our gun laws, but we need some reasonable, good faith proposals first.",1617994099.0,gtymeo2,t1_gtuvbzk,/r/politics/comments/mmwqq4/megathread_president_joseph_biden_announces/gtymeo2/,1.0,1618008499.0,"t1_gtuvbzk, thing, face, sales, guns, handguns, power, argument, rifles, background, checks, action, shotguns, fire, capacity, rds, people, hoops, right, benefit, gun, nut, bunch, amp, city, stereotypes, %, connections, delays, complications, Shall, issue, licenses, requirements, board, set, criteria, appeals, process, one, reason, firearms, permits, weapon, transport, case, state, law, circumstances, home, repair, range, purpose, trip, work, farm, stops, way, camping, hiking, areas, years, encounters, wildlife, campsite, trails, tent, car, License, exceptions, interest, permit, worries, backpack, wilderness, carry, pistol, magazines, lot, time, laws, access, uses, fear, prosecution, need, restrictions, standard, purposes, situation, exception, ton, classes, crowds, public, rest, owners, rights, society, blanket, opposition, mouth, idiots, ones, faith, proposals",0.4250163078930202,0.09539376148965194,0.0

"Left-leaning Canadian here.

Canada has background checks and firearms licensesand some firearms are classified as ""restricted"" and require additional background checks.  However, these things didn't stop someone who did not have a firearms license from acquiring and using illegal guns to kill 22 people in 2020, or stop another person from using an illegal handgun to kill two and wound 13 in 2018.  It's *really hard* to stop someone who's got years to plan and isn't concerned about the law.

I think it's also a mistake to focus on mass killings, when *by far* the majority of firearm deaths are suicide, followed by non-mass shootings (often by gang members).

"The thing that makes Mormonism uniquely goofy is that it’s recent, rather than ancient people who genuinely didn’t know how things worked and made up stories to explain life.

"No, Trump lead it. He telegraphed it for four years saying at his rallies, ""I've got the police, I've got the military, I've got bikers for Trump. They don't want to get rough but they will if they have to.""

Trump sent out one of his most stunning calls to arms in the summer of 2020 in Lafayette Square when he held up the bible prop as a signal to his Christian, white nationalist base but it didn't work. A few months later he told them to come to D.C. to protect MAGA or something but this call to arms fell flat too. Not long after this he gave the more well documented speech/tweet (I don't remember which) saying come to D.C. on Jan 6th, ""It's going to be wild!.""

On the day of the violent attempted overthrow of U.S. government, Brooks, Giuliani, Trump Jr, and Trump senior, all gave clearly inciting speeches with Trump senior saying a lot of things I still can't believe aren't more widely repeated.

(Article the other day notes Facebook doesn't hire black people, it was FB data that Cambridge used to help Trump.)  Not Russia.  Aaron Mate won awards for debunking all this Russiagate nonsense.  Netanyahu bragged in the Israeli press that he controls Trump--Kushner has known Bibi his whole life. But Putin controlling Trump is still pushed on NBC news daily.

Hillary had the 2016 DNC primary rigged-- this gets dismissed as a conspiracy theory but you van actually read the contract yourself, and plenty of staff admit it including Donna Brazile in her book. This whole past primary was rigging upon rigging upon rigging.  Haaretz and AIPAC even made known that Israel approved ANY MEANS NECESSARY to stop Bernie.

"The kind of ID required matters. Voter ID laws in the past have required, for example, a driver's license, which disenfranchises everyone who doesn't own a car. Guess which demographic that tends to be.

Again, voter ID laws have been found unconstitutional by SCOTUS [as recently as 2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/us/politics/voter-id-laws-supreme-court-north-carolina.html) because they ""target African-Americans with almost surgical precision.""

"&gt; It really does look like Manchin has all the power to screw up any of these measures he so chooses all by himself, &amp; listening to him he appears to act like he knows it too.

My point is that if the Republicans truly are just going to check out of the Senate while the Democrats are in control, then the Senate is functionally just about rallying the 50 Democratic Senators to vote yes on legislation. Currently, only the conservative Dems (Manchin and Sinema) are willing to threaten to withhold their votes to change certain parts of the bills. So say Manchin refuses to vote yes on a bill that includes a $15 minimum wage, someone like Sanders or Warren absolutely could say they refuse to vote on the bill without it, or they could threaten to withhold their votes on legislation that Manchin really wants to get passed. That said, I absolutely expect that establishment Dems would hold progressives to a different standard than they do moderates.

&gt; These younger progressives do need to truly understand how it works in congress at the moment &amp; realize that they sometimes just give republicans their talking points.

This argument would hold more weight if the establishment Dems made more of a concerted effort to shift the balance in Congress (heavy push for DC/Puerto Rico statehood, expand the House, end gerrymandering, end the filibuster, etc), and if they didn't actively use Republican talking points against members of their own party. For me it's not an issue of not understanding how things work, it's understanding that the way things currently work is untenable for the vast majority of Americans. The Democrats' focus on following procedure and ""doing things the right way"" are what have brought us to this point. Republicans have shifted further right, the wealthy have gotten significantly richer while the middle class and working class have gotten poorer and seen no improvement to their working conditions or quality of life. *""If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?""*

&gt; Progressive supporters need to really start showing up nationally to vote more than they have been. That's just a fact. Hopefully they will &amp; then their elected folks WILL have more leverage. It is a numbers game &amp; they DO have the numbers if they show up.

Putting the onus entirely on progressives is part of the issue here, though, especially when the Democrats routinely throw the progressive members of their party under the bus. Large swaths of progressive voters are kept from voting entirely due to voter disenfranchisement. The Democratic party does have the power to meaningfully shift the balance in their favor going forward, but they have not yet made it a top priority. They've absolutely have some efforts underway, but they don't have the urgency you would expect from a party that has consistently called the rise of the MAGA Republicans a fundamental, existential threat to democracy.",1617993334.0,gtykpr0,t1_gtydkdi,/r/politics/comments/mmp777/why_the_us_senate_is_so_broken_manchin_vow_to/gtykpr0/,1.0,1618007734.0,"gt, t1_gtydkdi, power, measures, amp, point, control, legislation, votes, parts, bills, refuses, bill, minimum, wage, establishment, progressives, standard, moderates, congress, moment, republicans, talking, points, argument, weight, effort, balance, push, statehood, gerrymandering, filibuster, members, party, issue, things, understanding, way, majority, focus, procedure, Republicans, class, working, improvement, conditions, quality, life, rule, use, supporters, fact, folks, leverage, numbers, game, onus, part, bus, swaths, voters, disenfranchisement, favor, priority, efforts, urgency, rise, threat, democracy",0.5346230158730159,0.17546296296296296,0.0
"It is specifically the senior Democrats who have a problem with messaging. You almost never hear strong messages from the top officials. 

Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer tend to speak in very broad platitudes about their ambitions. 

While I can understand that it is tough to try and unify a party as diverse as the modern DNC, they don't ever truly advocate for their platform from an appealing argument.

They say things like ""our plan is to pass x legislation"" but they never make a statement on the ethos or logos of that position. Or when they do, its a very subdued explanation like ""its what the American people need"".

Republicans are very strong at ethos/pathos messaging to their base, to the point of absurd hyperbole. ""We will win so much youre gonna be tired of winning"" etc.

Democrats are still stuck in the 90s pretending that the general public cares about ""taking the high road"" and not ridiculing the absurd position that others take.

Part of me thinks this is because of the age of senior leadership, but I believe in reality this is the result of any political party ""system"". Dems want to be seen as the opposite of Republicans, and so that means they refuse to fight on an even playing field.

"I don't deny that the ebb and flow of things over a time span of multiple generations means that the pendulum might swing towards a risk of a left-authoritarian Stalin-ish danger within America 70 years from now.  But right now, the danger to our Constitution comes from the right-authoritarians clearly.  The same people who are taking a radicalized stance that no restriction on gun ownership is allowed or that tracking guns to reduce the flow of guns into the hands of gang members may be allowed.  In this thread, I've seen nutso arguments like ""We can't register guns because if the list leaked, then people would target the non-gun-owners!""

The Venn diagram of ""right-wing authoritarians who want to get rid of actual democracy and have dictatorial or single-party rule"" and ""people who take a radicalized stance of saying that no restriction on gun ownership, or licensing or registration should be allowed in any form"" have massive overlap.  Not all ""gun nuts"" are a threat to our Constitution and democracy, but many are, and very few would actually defend our duly elected current government.  Right now, if there was a right-wing coup from the upper-middle-ranks of the military to overthrow Congress and the President, a large number of ""proud pro 2A"" folks would support it.  Many would support a ""new southern Confederate secession.""

"Exactly. The threats are evolving. Our adversaries are pushing boundaries and pouring millions of dollars into hypersonic weapons, electronic warfare, cyber attacks, corporate espionage, psychological warfare, (social media &amp; propaganda), etc. 

If the US and NATO don’t keep up, China or Russia will dominate. If we don’t arm our Navy with the best weapons, how can we protect the South China Sea? If we don’t protect it who’s going to ensure that nations like Taiwan or Vietnam can freely participate in international commerce? Our allies depend on our ability to deter bad actors. Same goes for former Soviet nations like Ukraine or Lithuania.

Yes there is wasteful spending in the military and in military contracts, but we can’t just stop. The alternative is worse than you all imagine. 

Now that we’re about to leave Afghanistan, intelligence agencies told the president that they may head to a civil war. The Taliban kills girls for going to school. This may seem like an extreme example but this is the kind of leadership that steps in we we leave.

"being outside the US you don't understand our country/culture/constitutional rights.. and I don't fault you for that.. I don't understand France/Germany/fill in the blank country.  


Our country was literally founded on the principal of person freedom and freedom from oppressive government.. so we have established in our constitution the right to own guns.. You can agree/disagree with the concept.. but it is there.. that is part of our national heritage.. and up until like the 70's this was a point of national pride (I have pictures of my dad and other family members who carried rifles/shotguns in the back window of their truck even into their high school parking lots) because at any point they might want/need them.. they had them.. and this was not seen as controversial but widely accepted behavior.  


We also can look at the actual statistics of these tragedies and see that the items they are pushing for in these E/O and laws would literally have little to no impact in the mass shooting category of deaths (which is where they are advocating from) and would instead make criminals out of the law abiding citizens who already have (or want to buy in the future) the items they want to regulate.. Its illogical to say this is 'for safety' while ignoring the actual stats.  


The gun control lobby is not honest about what they are doing.. if they were.. they would be trying to regulate/ban hand guns as this is where the vast majority of deaths (self harm, murder, mass shootings) come from.. but they know they can't get the support they need here (yet) so they go after the 'scary stuff' using emotional arguments that don't actually make sense.. because they KNOW this won't stop anything.. but once the scary stuff is gone.. they will have no other choice than to start  going after the hand guns and what not..  That is why its viewed as a power grab.

I would recommend watching a lot of [Colion Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aYNizuXu8c) videos..

"Time for some education: Non-serialized guns are legal (in most states), and building a gun at home for personal use has been protected since our founding.

"Here's what I think is the ""way of the crybabies that didn't get their way."" A Supreme Court justice dies when the president doesn't belong to the same party as the crybabies.

So they refused to do their constitutional duty of advice and consent, because they didn't get their way of Antonin Scalia dying while a Republican was president. 

Then, four years after they made a bunch of excuses about why you shouldn't do a Supreme Court confirmation in an election year (the voters should get to decide), they once again didn't get their way of Ruth Bader Ginsburg dying before an election year when a Republican was president, so they just broke all their own rules and confirmed her replacement during an election year anyway, because they didn't actually want to let the voters decide who should appoint her replacement; they wanted a radical conservative.

If your first choice is eliminated,  your vote goes to the next *remaining* candidate, *which is not guaranteed to be your second choice*.

That's true,  but kinda irrelevant.   You have to get over 50% in *one particular head to head election*, not against *any* other candidate.

If the final round is A vs B and A wins, that doesn't imply that if the final round were A vs C that A would still win. 

In other words,  in a lot of ranked choice elections,  whether or not A wins or C wins is determined by if B or C is eliminated first.

"Yes. Absolutely. After the watering down of the ACA in 2009, and the obstruction of McConnell I absolutely would have supported it to actually see some meaningful progress made for the American people.

Especially because the filibuster is a one-sided tool. Because republicans *don’t want* to pass legislation. The only thing that they care about when they’re in power is cutting taxes, and they can do that with the budget reconciliation process.

If republicans were trying to pass restrictive bills I may have a different take on things, but they don’t care to legislate at all. And even if they were, I still believe that a filibuster should have to work the way I laid it out above. Filibuster to your heart’s content, but it can’t be as simple as one person reading children’s books while the rest of the party fucks off home. Force the filibuster-er to make substantive arguments against the legislation. Force the filibuster supporters to maintain their presence in the senate chamber. That’s functionally the way the filibuster used to work (minus the 40 votes to maintain vs. 60 for cloture) and I really don’t think it’s onerous to bring back. 

Bipartisanship in the legislative branch is dead. Newt Gingrich killed it in the house, and Mitch McConnell killed it in the senate.

"The rates of defensive gun use isn't well studied but rates are estimated to be somewhere between 65,000 to 2.5 million a year. Injuries from negligent discharges are low and easily avoided if firearms are handled safely and storied properly. The handgun I might use for self-defense would either be on my person or stored in a quick access safe. It isn't going to just go off by itself. Any weapon I might use for self-defense has I light so I can identify what I might be aiming at. I actually practice with it so I can use it effectively. I have other security measures/practices to reduce the likelihood I would have to use it as well as pepper spray in the event lethal force isn't quite justified. Still it's possible I might have to use it and owning it isn't hurting anything.

Issues with mental health would be more of a personal decision for a lot of people if they weren't involuntary committed. There are organizations that help people by holding on to firearms if a person doesn't trust themselves temporarily. Then there is also a rather big issue of people actually getting affordable treatment for issues before it gets out of control. Ideally mental health would be part of a public option for healthcare.

Issues of domestic violence would be an issue regardless of firearms in the house and I'm not opposed to people convicted of something like that becoming prohibited persons. Currently there are laws about felons and domestic abuse. There can be gaps based on state laws often related to what counts. I think the main road block to that being more comprehensive has been police unions because too many cops wouldn't be allowed to be armed.

And just like religious institutions, the party is extremely susceptible to cults of personality, and they are willing to ignore anything as long as the leadership shows contrition when caught (because any sins can be forgiven if you ask for forgiveness), because after all, the other side isn't just wrong, they're *evil*.",1617991376.0,gtygc9s,t1_gtxyarv,/r/politics/comments/mnf59f/feds_are_investigating_whether_matt_gaetz/gtygc9s/,1.0,1618005776.0,"climate, conservatives, ideals, way, society, folks, allies, issues, party, Things, 60s-80s, repubs, problem, soul, evangelicalism, undercurrent, dominionism, core, debate, test, obedience, war, tactics, hordes, institutions, cults, personality, leadership, contrition, sins, forgiveness, side, t1_gtxyarv, *",0.5010582010582011,-0.06421957671957673,0.0

"Ten warning signs of a potentially unsafe group/leader per Rick Ross, Expert Consultant and Intervention Specialist:

* Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability.

* No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.

* No meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget, expenses such as an independently audited financial statement.

* Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions.

* **There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil**.

* Former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances.

* There are records, books, news articles, or television programs that document the abuses of the group/leader.

* Followers feel they can never be ""good enough"".

* The group/leader is always right.

I wrote this copypasta 6 months ago and my [original source](https://twitter.com/7im/status/1299068548069744641) is dead. I'm assuming that the new Rolling Stone article linked above has the same quotes I've used from the original.

&gt;“**We have to get rid of this group of people,**” he said. **Beth insisted his beliefs were widely shared.** “I’m tired of being politically correct. **I don’t think I’m saying anything different than most people in society aren’t thinking, but they’re afraid to say it.** And I’m just to the point that I’m saying.”

&gt;“Let’s let’s stop them from truly, at least some of **these males going out and getting 10 other women pregnant** and having small children,”

&gt;“**These people have to be warehoused**,” he said. “No recreational time in the jails.” The purpose? “**We put them away for the rest of their lives so that *the rest of us* can be better.**” Beth insisted the investment in these facilities would pay dividends in public safety, and that “**after this generation is gone — they’ve perished in these buildings** — we can turn them into something else. Maybe it’ll be malls, maybe Amazon will buy them as warehouses later.”

To summarize, Sheriff Beth thinks that ""these people"" need to be locked up for life so that they stop making babies. Once ""these people"" are all dead or too old to make babies, there won't be any more crime and the jails can be repurposed. It really seems like ""these people"" share a common genetic trait that Sheriff Beth wants to eliminate to make ""the rest of us"" feel safer.

It’s also possible to make your own cheap seeds from feminized plants if you buy some relatively pure silver, some alligator clips, batteries, and a jug of distilled water to make colloidal silver (you spray it on a flowering female plant and it will develop male organs and make pollen that you can then use to fertilize another female plant and make feminized seeds).

(2) No person shall directly or indirectly give or promise anything of value to another intending thereby to buy that person’s or another’s vote or to corruptly influence that person or another in casting his or her vote. Any person who violates this subsection is guilty of a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084. However, this subsection shall not apply to the serving of food to be consumed at a political rally or meeting or to any item of nominal value which is used as a political advertisement, including a campaign message designed to be worn by a person.

And/or maybe this one...

104.091 Aiding, abetting, advising, or conspiring in violation of the code.— (1) **Any person who knowingly aids, abets, or advises the violation of this code shall be punished in like manner as the principal offender.** (2) Any person who agrees, conspires, combines, or confederates with another person to commit a violation of this code shall be punished as if he or she had committed the violation. (3) Any person who knows of a felony violation of this code and gives any aid to the offender who has violated this code, with intent that the offender avoid or escape detection, arrest, trial, or punishment, shall be punished as if he or she had committed the violation. This subsection does not prohibit a member of The Florida Bar from giving legal advice to a client.

"&gt; This mentality just seems completely useless to me.

Ok.

&gt; No we don’t get things by compromising.

Let me ask, what things have you actually gotten? Because the people with this particular attitude haven’t gotten much of anything in my lifetime. Compromises get policy, just not always policy they’d make with their genie wish.

&gt; We get things by coming together to demand from our elected officials.

Fifty members of the senate are completely unphased by your demands. A few of the members that are sympathetic also have to cater to many of the kind of people who put the other 50 there or be replaced with a carbon copy of them. Before you can get a goddamn by coming together and making demands, you need to come together and convince a lot of people whose votes have disproportionate power to see things your way or give up the disproportionate power they hold. Good luck with that.

For now, demand all you like. Based on the current makeup of government, all your demands and $5 will get you a cup of coffee. We need some movement towards better to happen now, desperately. Even if your strategy works, the timeline for it working is two years at minimum and probably at least ten. We don’t have that amount of time.

&gt; They should be scared of us.

They’re not. And, frankly, the people on the far other end of the spectrum from you are heavily-armed Nazis who tried to overthrow the government by force a few months ago. So, you don’t really have a decent shot of outscarying your ideological opponents for the right or the middle.

&gt; We, the people cannot be happy with what the current situation or it will only get worse.

People like you have been saying this for decades. And all your ideological purity plays have succeeded in nothing but weakening Democrats enough for us to slide into fascism. Right now, despite political headwinds, Democrats are making and starting to enact the boldest progressive agenda in 90 years and you’re acting like they’re still your enemy because they’re not raising the corporate tax rate as much as you want today.

I don’t know if you realize this, but you’re going to convince them of nothing except that you are unreasonable and your vote is not winnable.

&gt; And all the corporate backed politicians want is for us to play into the game of trade offs and compromises

Have you never had to design something, or write code, or make a budget? All of life is about trade offs and compromises. You never get perfection. If you keep expecting it, you’re going to find a way to be indignant about fully automated luxury space communism if you get a chance.

&gt; so that we convince each other that us simple serfs have no real understanding of the situation

I think you lack an understanding of the situation because you speak in slogans and think vague “demands” are going to get you policy concessions despite obvious political realities. It’s got nothing to do with your class. It has to do with your clear ideological blinders and inability/unwillingness to contend with the existence of nuance.

&gt;The real change comes from having overwhelming majorities of legislators willing to vote yes on a policy of change, or smaller majorities that are in total ideological lockstep. How you get there is variable, but “being in the streets” is generally ineffective in spite of some high profile examples of it working. For example, there have been dozens of large scale demonstrations and even a few straight up riots over racist police use of force. And still police budgets go up and cops kill black people without accountability.

So tell me, when you reach the point that you’re in the streets every six months and it accomplishes nothing, what’s step 2? Because what I’m hearing is that you think all it takes is: step 1. everybody being pissed off, step 2. ???, step 3.

Could put in other rules too, like in Canada chief justice must come from different regions of the country. 3 have to be trained in Quebec or in Canadian civil law, 2/3 must be trained in Ontario, 2/3 must be trained in Atlantic Canada, 3 in Western Canada, with at least one judge from BC, one from Manitoba, and 1 from either Alberta/Saskatchewan.

Could do the same, one judge from trained from each circuit region of  the country. I.e. at least one judge from 1/2/3 circuit, another from the DC/4/11 circuit, one from 7/6, one from the 8th, eon from the 5th, one from the 10th, and one from the 9th. Alternatively expand the court to 13 judges, with each coming from a different circuit. 

Take the current Chief Justice, he was nominated by Harper as a puisne justice and elevated to role of Chief Justice by Trudeau. Same thing with his predecessor, McLachlin was appointed by Mulroney to the court as a puisine justice, and elevated to Chief Justice by Chretien.

"Not always the case.. many crimes are committed with stolen guns (family stealing from family, randoms stealing from homes, etc) and the ACTUAL gun owner did nothing wrong..   


One of the mass shootings a few years ago was a kid who got into their parents safe (we could argue about this particular part of the story all day.. so I am glossing over it for now) and took his (IIRC mom's) gun and killed people with it.  The gun owner did nothing wrong...   


But to be more fair to your argument.. this could be said about drivers.. all drivers are one second.. one slight decision away from killing people (intentional or not.. and lets be fair.. [more people die in automobile wrecks](https://vpc.org/regulating-the-gun-industry/gun-deaths-compared-to-motor-vehicle-deaths/))  and I use this particular link for 2 reasons.. it leans 'left' in so much as it promotes additional gun laws and 2, it still shows car wrecks at a higher volume.. The only reason(s) for the decline is technology has started taking over drivers inabilities to drive safe (lane switching, auto breaking, better/more air bags, etc) where as a firearm is still going to be as safe/deadly as the person wielding it.  


None of the proposed laws/EO would have any real impact on anyone other than the actual responsible gun owners.. meaning in 2 months.. a year.. 10 years.. whatever the timeframe is.. a new person will commit a crazy terrible act.. and then they will again go after some more.. then another period of time will pass and someone does something terrible.. they chip a bit more away.. all of this while mostly ignoring all/most of the underlying issues.",1617990521.0,gtyedh7,t1_gtxzh9j,/r/politics/comments/mnj8s5/we_will_not_allow_this_in_tx_texas_governors/gtyedh7/,1.0,1618004921.0,"case, crimes, guns, family, homes, t1_gtxzh9j, gun, owner, mass, shootings, years, kid, parents, part, story, day, mom, people, argument, drivers, second, decision, automobile, regulating, industry, deaths, motor, vehicle, link, reasons, laws, car, wrecks, volume, reason(s, decline, technology, inabilities, lane, switching, auto, breaking, air, bags, firearm, person, None, impact, owners, meaning, months, year, timeframe, act, period, time, bit, issues",0.48428641251221904,0.07832355816226784,0.0

"&gt;We spend 51% of our taxes on the military

Do you understand the difference between discretionary spending and taxes?  Because they are NOT the same thing.  The Military is 51% of discretionary spending, not 51% of taxes.

The [Congressional Budget Office figures for 2019](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2020-04/56324-CBO-2019-budget-infographic.pdf) - the last pre-pandemic year - show that we spent $676 Billion on military of a 4.4 trillion total budget.  That works out to 15.3%.

I'd like to slash our military budget to maybe 1/4 or 1/3 its current size, but that would drop my taxes by maybe 10%, not by anything close to 51%.

"&gt;In a way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane. They simply swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because it left no residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird.

"&gt;You may want familiarize yourself with self defense laws then.

I'm pretty familiar.  It is a legal defense used to justify one's actions when one has committed a crime like battery or murder.  Things that are taken into account in weighing a self defense justification include *escalation of force* and choosing not to remove oneself from a situation when that option is available.

In the Rittenhouse case, he continued to insert himself into a situation where he was clearly being provoked by the first victim.  He was not physically attacked at that point.  He clearly had an overwhelming advantage in firepower.  I haven't seen what caused the foot chase prior to Rittenhouse turning and shooting.  I'm guessing that he said something stupid and then realized that he made a grave error.  Rittenhouse put himself in that situation (repeatedly...he kept going back to that man all night) and he escalated the level of force by using a firearm when the other person was unarmed.  There is little to no chance that an impartial jury is going to award him self defense in that scenario.

Once he shot the first victim, the entire scenario changes.  Now he is an active shooter and he doesn't get a claim of self defense against the crowd that he just fired into...at all.  Even if the first murder was justified, he is now the aggressor.  The other ""attackers"" have to be viewed from the perspective of dealing with an active shooter.  He doesn't get carte blanc to just go on a killing spree because people are trying to stop him from killing people.

So against the first victim, Rittenhouse helped to create the situation and did not remove himself from it.  He also escalated the level of violence by using a firearm against an unarmed man (at range no less).

Against the second victim, Rittenhouse was in an aggressor position as dictated by the situation and he escalated the level of violence by shooting a man armed with a skateboard.

Against the third victim, he was again the aggressor.  That man was armed and didn't shoot Rittenhouse when he clearly could have.",1617989836.0,gtyctia,t1_gty11td,/r/politics/comments/mnb9yi/enough_prayers_time_for_some_action_biden/gtyctia/,1.0,1618004236.0,"self, defense, laws, actions, crime, battery, murder, Things, account, justification, escalation, force, situation, option, t1_gty11td, case, victim, point, advantage, firepower, foot, chase, Rittenhouse, shooting, error, man, night, level, firearm, person, chance, jury, scenario, changes, shooter, claim, crowd, aggressor, attackers, perspective, carte, blanc, killing, spree, people, violence, range, position, skateboard",0.35541474654377886,0.05255376344086025,0.0

"That's because the government has needs to fill for its people.  It's manipulating the market for its needs the same way that a consumer would with their demand at the store.  Look at GPU's the prices are rising, not just scalpers, but because there is so much demand for product.  The government subsidizes these industries for the consumer so that prices of gas are low and the availability of it is extremely regular.  If it were left up to market whims, like GPU's currently are, then when the Saudis or someone else decides to throw a fit you might not be able to fill up your car with gas.  That's not much of a problem anymore with oil/gas because we're an exporter now, but the reasons for subsidies in the first place may not be unreasonable or even anti-capitalism.

"It is currently much cheaper to “over-generate” power compared to building a ton of storage.   So regardless of the source, we are going to wind up with extra generation at times which would otherwise be wasted.

And that’s what the military has been used for in the 1800s (Mexican American war), 1900s (destabilizing Latin America), 2000s (destabilizing the Middle East and declaring wars on false premises), and today. Nowhere here has the military proved to me that they are the “protectors of democracy and peace” but act for the hands of the rich in most scenarios. 

Like, we should still make our presence known in the South China Sea. Because China is annexing that region illegally. We should be putting military pressure on Russia for annexing Crimea from the Ukraine and back Ukraine in their military efforts.

"There's zero chance of China engaging the US. If China attacks any US forces in the area it triggers NATO treaty obligations. 

I'm not quite sure why you're bringing up the airfields/missile range argument since any in theater airfields operating craft that could reach China would naturally be in the Intermediate missile range envelope. There's a trickier issue with them actually USING those missiles though as it could trigger SSBN launch protocols based on the profile of the attack birds. 

I think you can safely rule out ANY DF-26B or DF-21 Launches in the vicinity of US craft. Any large scale launch of ballistic missiles at all would trigger some uncomfortable protocols.

A strike by China would likely be focused entirely on Taiwan. Taiwan would probably flush their entire stock of LACM and their newer long range missiles in such an eventuality.

Frankly, the missile defense systems in existence aren't good enough to matter much in this sort of conflict. 

There's no way that Taiwan can prevent itself from being overwhelmed, but it won't be quick and it won't be clean.

China cannot actually win this type of conflict. They would be crippled economically and quite possibly militarily.

"The president has the constitutional power to select justices. The president has a mandate from the People in the exercise of this power, so the president's choice is the People's choice, no matter when in a president's term it is. The Senate also has a check on the president's choice in refusing to confirm. The People have two opportunities to be heard in the selection of a justice. The Senate, however, has a constitutional duty to advise and determine consent on a presidential appointment. Consent and the lack thereof cannot be determined without a vote, and the requirement of advice requires due consideration and suggests that denial of an appointment requires grounds. The Republican faction of the Senate in 2016 refused to uphold its constitutional duties. This posed a constitutional crisis, and the best solution to a constitutional crisis is to avoid conflict where it may be avoided, and to reach a reasoned compromise. A new understanding of Senate duty was proposed by the Senate Republicans - that the Senate should abstain from confirming a presidential appointment to the Supreme Court when a seat opens within the last year of a president's term, as the people, now with the awareness of the immediacy of such a significant decision to be made, should have a say in how the seat is filled. This new understanding of the Constitution suggests that the president's mandate is weakened over the course of his/her term, and is so weak in this area by the last year as to be unworthy of effectuating presidential appointment to the highest court. The president and Democratic senators, to avoid a legal and political battle the Republicans threatened, withheld from pursuing their constitutional duties and rights premised on an agreement to the new proposed understanding. The actions of the Republican senators in 2020, in their rush to fill Ginsburg's seat, can be understood under two comparisons to civil actions: a breach of contract or fraud. If it could be a civil action, a court could very well prevent the Republicans from filling the seat by way of the doctrine of estoppel - a party can be precluded from acting in a way contrary to actions that party took upon which another party reasonably relied. This doctrine cannot be applied by a court because the Judiciary and the Legislature are coequal branches, and one cannot interfere in the internal processes of another. However, estoppel is built on our society's conception of justice, and the acts of the Republicans, whether or not they can be governed by a court, thus remain unjust. Filling the seat created an unjustly comprised Court, one built on fraud.

This creates an issue of legitimacy. There is no force in our polity that compels obedience to the Supreme Court, and our entire system is built on presumed legitimacy of the coequal branches. The agreement in 2016 was struck by representatives of the People. The People voted in 2016 with this understanding of what their representatives had promised. The breach of that agreement is a fraud on the People. 2020 created new mandates - a Democratic president with a mandate from the people, as well as a Democratic-majority Congress with a mandate from the people. But the Supreme Court's anatomy has been created through a fraud on the People - no mandate. What are two branches with mandates to do when opposed by a third with none? If that occurs, the Republicans will have created another constitutional crisis.",1617989245.0,gtybh4u,t1_gty3eyx,/r/politics/comments/mnk1du/biden_creates_commission_to_study_potential/gtybh4u/,1.0,1618003645.0,"president, power, justices, mandate, t1_gty3eyx, exercise, choice, term, check, People, opportunities, selection, justice, duty, consent, appointment, lack, vote, requirement, advice, consideration, denial, grounds, faction, duties, crisis, solution, conflict, compromise, understanding, seat, year, people, awareness, immediacy, decision, say, course, area, court, senators, battle, rights, agreement, actions, rush, comparisons, breach, contract, fraud, action, way, doctrine, estoppel, party, branches, processes, society, conception, acts, issue, legitimacy, force, polity, obedience, system, representatives, mandates, majority, anatomy, third, none",0.3548340548340547,0.12002164502164503,0.0

"On the subject of court packing and / or reform:     
      
On one hand, people need to understand that packing the court inevitably leads to a situation where the court ends up as a completely illegitimate rubber stamper of whichever party is currently in power.      
       
On the other hand, I’m sick of conservatives trying to act like the current court has much in the way of legitimacy.  Not just because the senate is basically gerrymandered in favor of republicans, although that too.  And not just because they confirmed Comey Barrett literally during the election, when tens of millions of people had already voted.  It’s more fundamental than that.             
       
We learned that when the requirement was 60 votes to confirm, it’s way to easy for a party to just completely obstruct.  If Clinton had won, the republicans would have tried to hold seats open for literally her entire term.  And now we are at a place where I assume neither party would be willing to cooperate in approving the nominees of the other.     
        
But with the requirement lowered to 50 votes, it means if the president’s party controls the senate, even by a narrow margin, then their party can UNILATERALLY fill vacancies with anybody they want.       
       
So going forward, it’s likely that we will have stretches where the presidency and senate don’t match, and no vacancies are filled, and then other times where parties alternate making **UNILATERAL** appointments based on whichever party is in power.     
       
And anybody who thinks “there are only two parties, and they take turns playing tug of war over who gets to make unilateral appointments” sounds like a reasonable system for a theoretically independent apolitically judiciary, is either a moron, or lying because they think their party can twist the system to their advantage.      
        
_____________      
         
Everybody is so busy trying to win this game of tug of war, nobody is taking about the fact that the game is fucked to begin with and the rope is about to snap.  It’s another example of how the two party system (and the voting method that causes it) is destroying this country.      
      
Packing the court should be used as an option only to force the other side to come to the table to negotiate an actual Supreme Court REFORM.  Like so many other things, the real solution is to change our electoral method to get rid of the two party system, but even within a two party system, you could try and change how appointments work in order to try and get something closer to an actual independent apolitical judiciary.     
       
And it won’t be fixed just by changing attitudes, you have to do something to change the actual game theory.  Some politicians love to talk about how we need more bipartisanship and less polarization, but apparently their plan is to hope the magical bipartisan fairy sprinkled some bipartisan fairy dust on everybody in the night.  But of course they aren’t serious because they don’t advocate any changes to the system that would allow for a multiparty system, or even changed to make a two party system (relatively) less polarized  and dysfunctional.",1617988919.0,gtyaqbi,t3_mnlpmr,/r/politics/comments/mnlpmr/biden_to_form_commission_to_study_overhauling_the/gtyaqbi/,1.0,1618003319.0,"subject, court, packing, reform, hand, people, situation, rubber, stamper, party, power, conservatives, way, legitimacy, t3_mnlpmr, favor, republicans, election, tens, millions, requirement, votes, seats, term, place, nominees, president, senate, margin, vacancies, stretches, presidency, times, parties, appointments, tug, war, system, judiciary, moron, advantage, _, game, fact, rope, example, voting, method, country, option, side, table, things, solution, order, attitudes, theory, politicians, bipartisanship, polarization, plan, fairy, dust, night, course, changes, multiparty, dysfunctional",0.4898809523809524,-0.01614010989010988,0.0

"The point is that he never touched her and it was a USO tour.  The Military was escorting and at no time did (contrary to LeeAnn's claim) was there ever any notice of issue UNTIL 12 years later.

The photo wasn't really an issue until LeeAnn applied #MeToo to it and then dropped into Fox News and Hannity through connections .  Everyone can see that so lots of ""photos"" are not consensual where nothing actually happened.  Franken only apologized because LeeAnn decided 12 years later to use it in a political attack on him through Hannity.  It is like me knowing about a photo for 12 years and waiting for that person to be useful for me to get publicity by making a claim which in essence forces someone to be a position they have no time to address and if they tried to address the public emotion was too hot void of facts.  Franken was declared ""guilty"" by the right wing and he should never have resigned.

""As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it"" said Franken, but in no way did he touch her like she did to Robin Williams and other males. She basically has double standards which she projects for personal gain.

"&gt; There is overwhelming proof that white people use more illegal drugs. Yet, the only way anyone can explain why Black people are arrested for possession at three times the rate of whites is the racist belief that there is a huge drug use problem in Black communities. Racism is the only way to explain why the largest policing project in world history revealed “Black drivers were searched about 1.5 to 2 times as often as white drivers, while they were less likely to be carrying drugs, guns, or other illegal contraband compared to their white peers.” It is necessary to believe that race is a “fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities” if one wants to understand why Black men receive prison sentences that are, on average, nearly 20 percent longer than white men who commit the same crimes.

...

&gt; As a powerful politician, Cotton understands—perhaps more than me or you—that people erroneously believe crime can be solved by arresting people and sending them to prison. Tom Cotton is aware that Black people are arrested and incarcerated at higher rates than they commit crimes. Cotton knows that the dog whistle of “under-incarceration” means that not enough Black people are behind bars. Tom Cotton knows there is no scientific or logical validity to his premise. But he also knows that most Americans tend to believe that crime is up and white people believe that imprisoning more Black people will solve the crime problem.

"&gt;don't you also think that people in this mindset also should be able to get access to help?

I think they should, but they should not be forced to get help.

&gt;Also, wouldn't it be nicer for literally everyone involved if euthanasia could be done in a more peaceful way that isn't expelling your brains from your skull? 

Yes it would, but they should not be forced to kill themselves in a ""government approved"" way if they don't want to 

&gt;Using this as an excuse for why guns should be unrestricted is a bad one.

But I didn't do that, I said that gun suicides fail to provide an argument in support of stricter gun control---from the point of view of someone who believes in the right to commit suicide.

Your arguments that gun suicides are awful and that people should be able to get help and die humanely do not suggest that gun suicides are sufficient for tighter gun control. They make for good arguments in support of better access to healthcare and medical aid in dying, but not better gun control.

Although I did not suggest firearm access is a good thing for suicidal people on the grounds of giving the right to kill themselves, I will do so now. Your arguments don't really refute this anyways. So what if some people might want more peaceful deaths? These options are not available to them and it's a personal choice anyways. Using a gun is a personal choice too, neither you or I are in a position to deny people the right to kill themselves on the grounds that it might make us uncomfortable  Ultimately, more restricted gun access would lead to people not having access to what is currently the most efficient accessible suicide method. This is no more ethical than denying an ill person the right to euthanasia. And no, access to guns does not affect access to assisted suicide negatively, so you can't claim that it does harm to people's right to kill themselves.",1617988685.0,gtya6ny,t1_gtxxca7,/r/politics/comments/mmwqq4/megathread_president_joseph_biden_announces/gtya6ny/,1.0,1618003085.0,"people, mindset, access, help, gt;Also, euthanasia, way, brains, skull, government, excuse, guns, one, gun, argument, support, control, point, view, right, suicide, arguments, suicides, healthcare, aid, firearm, thing, grounds, deaths, options, choice, position, method, person, harm",0.4862925170068027,0.0786734693877551,0.0

"Yeah. Social security numbers are used to steal people's money, not their votes. People don't hide in some dark corner and plan to use someone's SS number to vote. You know why? Because that shit gets you caught almost immediately. If you try and register with someone's SSN that isn't yours, and they're already registered, you're out of luck on getting the registration card. If they didn't register and you try and vote for them? It still gets you caught, because the mail goes to the original owner of that SSN. Plus, you'd have to vote in an area that the current owner of the SSN lives in, which would definitely get you caught, and wouldn't even be worth the effort. 

It's hard as fuck to use an SSN to vote illegally. Plus, you can use SSN to create fake IDs, which would, guess what, invalidate your argument for voter IDs. 

You're hurting your own argument. If SSN are so easy to get ahold of to vote illegally, like you claim, then they're just as easy to use to create fake IDs.

"Except it’s not subjective at all. Those were facts. The opinions on those facts are what’s subjective. 

And you could call the mueller investigation a “witch hunt” except it 100% verified Russian interference which broke our laws, and it basically said “Trump may or may not have been in on it.” Sure it could have wasted tax dollars because everybody already knew there was Russian interference. Just like having something similar to the 2020 election would be a waste of tax dollars because every (sane) American knows there wasn’t significant voter fraud. 

As for the covid relief bill? Yeah some extra fluff in there but saying 9% helper is just wrong. And calling it bail out for blue states is also wrong. And I guess repairing infrastructure is also something we shouldn’t be worried about.

Here’s what I’ve found the difference to be and why ive swapped from Republican to Democratic recently. Republicans sit there and blame the system and do nothing because the system is broken.

"This is a popular reddit talking point, but it's *wildly* misleading. The Pentagon did not lose $1.2 trillion. The Pentagon *did* find $1.2 trillion worth of unsigned accounting errors, or changes in the accounting record that couldn't be backed up with receipts or paperwork.

Imagine for a moment you run a business complaining about military spending on the internet. According to your books, you earned $10,000 in revenue and paid $14,000 in expenses for a net operating loss of $4,000. 

You get your bank statements, though, and something's wrong. They show you received $20,000 in payments and only paid $7,000 in expenses. Looking through the numbers, you remember getting a bonus from your client by hitting 100 posts a day that you didn't record.

&gt; Rep. Matt Gaetz, currently embroiled in a scandal tying him to an indicted former official in Florida who has been charged with sex-trafficking crimes, reportedly paid that person in two transactions containing the same amount of money later sent to three women.

&gt; Gaetz has denied involvement with Greenberg&amp;#039;s activities, but in one of the memo fields of the transactions, the congressman wrote &amp;quot;Hit up ,&amp;quot; with the blank space being the name of one of the women Greenberg would eventually forward the money to.

&gt; Actions, prompted Rep. Adam Kinzinger to call for Gaetz to resign, becoming the first Republican official in Congress to do so.

"&gt;My point is corruption is the foundation of both political parties in this country. Both sides are doing the same things.

How the fuck is Acorn the foundation of the DNC? What are you talking about?

&gt; Yet a number expressed their view that Democratic officials accused of sexual misconduct have lost their jobs in recent years while Republicans haven’t — a misperception mostly driven by impressions of Mr. Franken’s resignation. It is a sentiment intertwined with lingering feelings about former President Donald J. Trump, who many Democrats believe never paid a political price after being accused of far worse treatment of women.

I only brought up Franken to prove that liberals have gone a bit overboard with this movement. I did not use Al Franken as proof that no conservatives were tossed for their abuses. Is there a more relevant bit to this article you'd like to paste? The article doesn't start talking about numbers of conservatives that have lost jobs and who haven't. This is a piece talking about how democrats are hoping to deal with this in the future as we have gone overboard, but there are still people like Cuomo that need to be thrown from the ship. Did you read the rest of the article? Do I need to read the rest of the article to understand your point? I don't get it.

&gt; With that being said, I view the accusations against Cuomo as a distraction from the bigger scandal, which was falsified reporting to the CDC and nursing home deaths caused by, at best, willful ignorance.

Totally agreed, but how is that relevant to this conversation about sexual abuse? Cuomo needs to be fired for a whole bunch of reasons and he will not be re-elected because of them.

&gt; And, yes, modern liberals have the ability to notice Joe Biden's perversions when Jon Stewart points them out in 2015 (to ensure a Clinton nomination), and then to ignore them in 2020.

Yes, let's compare and contrast the accusations of Donald Trump to Clinton and Biden. I didn't bring up Trump because the problem is bigger than the presidency. People hold their noses to vote for the president. We held our noses and voted against Trump. I did not vote for Biden in the primary. Dems have this problem, but Acorn and Biden do not prove that it's just as big a problem as it is in the conservative party.

"The intractable debate over which guns are OK has accidentally created a form of hysteria that is, itself, the real problem we have now. As panic over losing their AR's and 30-round magazines builds, people spin up increasingly terrified images of civil warfare, race wars, or class conflict - creating a very real sense of need for guns to combat all these imagined scenarios.

But the side-effect is simple and devastating: the mass-shooters, generic single-victim killers, and the pro-gun lobby all believe in the central message of that debate: Guns Solve Problems. And when that idea becomes gospel, a person reaching their own personal limit - whether their feelings are suicidal, homicidal, or outright pathological - all refer back to the gospel truth: a gun will solve this problem.

Then they act, using the gun to solve the problem they're facing. Down goes the wife, or the wife and kids, or her boyfriend, or her co-workers. Down goes the congregation in a place of worship that preaches a different way of imagining God. Down goes the boss who fired them, or the co-workers who didn't get canned at the same time. And in moments of sheer psychopathic rage, down goes any convenient victim.

If we can all get this argument simmered back down, and talk about how rarely the circumstances should justify gunfire, we might have a chance of putting this genie back into his bottle.

"The guiding principle should be, “If the Republicans had the chance, would they use this to their benefit?”


The answer is yes. So I don’t know what else this committee will be talking about other than term limits (which I think is a bad idea), but it should be a pretty short discussion. Under the necessary and proper clause, It is legal to expand the court and if given the chance, the GOP will use that argument to expand the court themselves the first chance they get. Therefore, Democrats have no choice but to seek it out first.


If Dems can expand the court, great. If it turns out using the necessary and proper clause is unconstitutional for this issue, then that ruling will eliminate any future GOP attempts to expand the courts for their own benefit. We need firm court-decided precedents on this because when it comes to appointing judges, the GOP does not abide by informal precedents (as we saw in the last two Supreme Court appointees).",1617987291.0,gty6ypw,t3_mnk1du,/r/politics/comments/mnk1du/biden_creates_commission_to_study_potential/gty6ypw/,1.0,1618001691.0,"principle, t3_mnk1du, chance, benefit, answer, committee, term, limits, idea, discussion, clause, court, argument, choice, issue, ruling, attempts, courts, precedents, judges, appointees",0.484375,0.08281250000000002,0.0

"Not exactly true. Hitler served 8 months of a 5 year sentence.

 Hitler and Hess were both sentenced to five years in [*Festungshaft*](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Festungshaft&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1) \[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festungshaft)\] ('fortress confinement') for treason. *Festungshaft*  was the mildest of the three types of jail sentence available in German  law at the time; it excluded forced labour, provided reasonably  comfortable cells, and allowed the prisoner to receive visitors almost  daily for many hours.

This is particularly useful for private investors.  Say you won 1 million in a lottery or stock sale.

"I would agree that he devalues woman since you can tell a lot about a man based on the jokes he makes and where he makes them. Frankly I do not have a problem with the words he says but it is often the context he puts it in.

However when it comes to leading a country I do not even care about that. I want the president to be a good leader almost in a Machiavellian sense. (although all politicians are). However frankly I personally believe trump has failed at that as well. Some people think Donald trump is the worse thing since hitler and others think the same for Biden.

"The democrats are.  They're just bad at it relative to the GQP. And the structure of our democracy magnifies the success of the party the rural portions of the country vote for.

It takes a special kind of person to be good at fleecing others. That kind of person naturally gravitates towards the GQP, because they have actively encouraged a culture around it. A culture of anything goes and fuck the consequences. To be fair to the GQP leadership: they're only allowed to do this because so many of their base are single issue voters who would vote for satan himself as long as satan promised to appoint justices that would repeal roe v. Wade or personally give every white baby an assault rifle. Corruption simply doesn't matter to the average GQP voter (except when its the other side being corrupt).

"The president has the constitutional power to select justices. The president has a mandate from the People in the exercise of this power, so the president's choice is the People's choice, no matter when in a president's term it is. The Senate also has a check on the president's choice in refusing to confirm. The People have two opportunities to be heard in the selection of a justice. The Senate, however, has a constitutional duty to advise and determine consent on a presidential appointment. Consent and the lack thereof cannot be determined without a vote, and the requirement of advice requires due consideration and suggests that denial of an appointment requires grounds. The Republican faction of the Senate in 2016 refused to uphold its constitutional duties. This posed a constitutional crisis, and the best solution to a constitutional crisis is to avoid conflict where it may be avoided, and to reach a reasoned compromise. A new understanding of Senate duty was proposed by the Senate Republicans - that the Senate should abstain from confirming a presidential appointment to the Supreme Court when a seat opens within the last year of a president's term, as the people, now with the awareness of the immediacy of such a significant decision to be made, should have a say in how the seat is filled. This new understanding of the Constitution suggests that the president's mandate is weakened over the course of his/her term, and is so weak in this area by the last year as to be unworthy of effectuating presidential appointment to the highest court. The president and Democratic senators, to avoid a legal and political battle the Republicans threatened, withheld from pursuing their constitutional duties and rights premised on an agreement to the new proposed understanding. The actions of the Republican senators in 2020, in their rush to fill Ginsburg's seat, can be understood under two comparisons to civil actions: a breach of contract or fraud. If it could be a civil action, a court could very well prevent the Republicans from filling the seat by way of the doctrine of estoppel  - a party can be precluded from acting in a way contrary to actions that party took upon which another party reasonably relied. This doctrine cannot be applied by a court because the Judiciary and the Legislature are coequal branches, and one cannot interfere in the internal processes of another. However, estoppel is built on our society's conception of justice, and the acts of the Republicans, whether or not they can be governed by a court, thus remain unjust. Filling the seat created an unjustly comprised Court, one built on fraud.

This creates an issue of legitimacy. There is no force in our polity that compels obedience to the Supreme Court, and our entire system is built on presumed legitimacy of the coequal branches. The agreement in 2016 was struck by representatives of the People. The People voted in 2016 with this understanding of what their representatives had promised. The breach of that agreement is a fraud on the People. 2020 created new mandates - a Democratic president with a mandate from the people, as well as a Democratic-majority Congress with a mandate from the people. But the Supreme Court's anatomy has been created through a fraud on the People - no mandate. What are two branches with mandates to do when opposed by a third with none? If that occurs, the Republicans will have created another constitutional crisis.",1617986550.0,gty58gi,t1_gty2nqd,/r/politics/comments/mnj6yc/biden_creating_commission_to_study_expanding_the/gty58gi/,1.0,1618000950.0,"president, power, justices, mandate, t1_gty2nqd, exercise, choice, term, check, People, opportunities, selection, justice, duty, consent, appointment, lack, vote, requirement, advice, consideration, denial, grounds, faction, duties, crisis, solution, conflict, compromise, understanding, seat, year, people, awareness, immediacy, decision, say, course, area, court, senators, battle, rights, agreement, actions, rush, comparisons, breach, contract, fraud, action, way, doctrine, estoppel, party, branches, processes, society, conception, acts, issue, legitimacy, force, polity, obedience, system, representatives, mandates, majority, anatomy, third, none",0.3548340548340547,0.12002164502164503,0.0

So either Biden wasn’t aware of the Saturday Night Massacre, something that was not illegal and obviously going to happen no matter how many people Nixon had to fire until he found someone willing to say yes, or he was lying when he said he would have no issue with a Bork nomination",1617986519.0,gty55y0,t1_gty43xw,/r/politics/comments/mnj6yc/biden_creating_commission_to_study_expanding_the/gty55y0/,1.0,1618000919.0,"Bork, t1_gty43xw, year, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bork_Supreme_Court_nomination, gt;*As, hearing.[21, opposition, nomination, approval, interview, conservatives, hearings, people, issue",0.38095238095238093,0.1547619047619048,0.0

"&gt; I mean there are 100% upstanding Republican candidates.

No. There are not. Not anymore. The GQP is now the party of Qanon, trumpism, obstructionism, sedition, and corruption. Plus they have way more sexual abusers than the Democratic Party. I used to occasionally vote for a Republican candidate at some level but not anymore.

Pretend you are a good hearted conservative person who wants to run for office. 

**Why in the world would you want to associate yourself with those people‽**

Self described Republicans who are conservative-liberal don’t want to run as independents. It’s because of money, of course. They want the RNC raising them money, providing them with office and staffing resources... in lower level office this might not be a lot of money but it’s probably still a consideration. If you’re running for Congress or the presidency, the RNC (or DNC) is going to throw millions of dollars in ads and support to you.

Money. It’s almost always money in the end. So I refuse to vote Republican because if they were a good person they would not associate themselves with those criminals and they would not be in it for the money.

"I liked this quote better from Ezra Klein (NYT's) (But still a headline fail.)

*Many who served under Obama, and who now serve under Biden, believe that they were so focused on economic risks that they missed the political risks — and you can’t make good economic policy if you lose political power. The Biden team is haunted by the fear that if they fail, a Trump-like strongman could recapture power. This helps explain why, for instance, they’re unmoved by arguments that the $1,400 stimulus checks, though wildly popular, were poorly targeted. As one of Biden’s economic advisers put it to me, “if we don’t show people we’re helping the dickens out of them, this country could be back to Trump way too quickly,” only he used an earthier word than “dickens.”*",1617986312.0,gty4okb,t3_mnl0a8,/r/politics/comments/mnl0a8/analysis_the_sneaky_radicalism_of_joe_bidens/gty4okb/,1.0,1618000712.0,"quote, t3_mnl0a8, headline, risks, policy, power, team, fear, Trump, strongman, instance, arguments, stimulus, checks, advisers, people, dickens, country, way, word",0.42000000000000004,0.14000000000000004,0.0

"This is true, but the other perspective to consider it from is if we're saying that cutting the budget would be removing ""X"" jobs that currently exist is that the reallocated budget put into rebuilding our infrastructure would create ""Y"" jobs that these people can be subsequently moved into.

The obvious problem is that people are so stuck believing that our budget is set a certain way and that past habits can't be adjusted so it must stay the way that it is.

For a personal home owner, if you had a ""new"" home that had no issues and could hypothetically spend half of it on guns because you had disposable income, there's no issue; but if the roof is leaking or the foundation has a legitimate problem, you would either need to get additional income or cut back on the discretionary spending in order to fix those issues. We don't seem to be willing to spend on the IRS so they can force those that aren't contributing to pay their fair share in taxes (or raise the corporate tax rate when companies are benefiting from our infrastructure) so until that changes, we have to cut back and we've already done it in other areas of the budget.",1617986302.0,gty4nnn,t1_gtxk7sr,/r/politics/comments/mnegcm/congress_urged_to_reject_bidens_unconscionable/gty4nnn/,1.0,1618000702.0,"perspective, budget, X, jobs, infrastructure, t1_gtxk7sr, people, problem, way, habits, home, owner, issues, half, guns, income, issue, roof, foundation, spending, order, share, taxes, tax, rate, companies, changes, areas",0.39074357015533484,0.022587216704863765,0.0

It could be argued that the fact that Article 3 distinguishes between the Supreme Court and Inferior Courts means they are separate offices, and that judges cannot be removed from either office (independently) except by impeachment for lack of good behavior.

"Covid happened before the 2020 election, so it most likely not a 9/11 type event for 22.  Vaccination was started under Trump, they were at 1 million doses per day when Biden took over.  

&gt;Many said, had trump done the bare minimum, he would have sailed to reelection.

And this

&gt;vaccinating the country and potentially not having to wear masks by 2022 and not having 500,000 americans dying yearly from covid might fit that bill.

Probably is not going to play out the way you think. 500,000 people dying from Covid is not all Trump's fault, many countries have a higher death rate than America. The States with the highest death rates are Democratically controlled.  Blaming Trump for what happened in New York is just dumb. If Cuomo's covid scandals were covered by the media before the election I think Trump would have won. 
The idea of wearing a mask until 22 is the reason people want Republicans. I am not an antimasker, but I hate working in a mask, it has made my life miserable.

Their foundations are too deep in it at this point.

So hear me out. There's ONE principal for the Republican party. One.

More money for the rich. Everything else is just in service towards that end.

 Abortion? They had 2 years of impunity and did nothing. 

Gun laws? Regan himself put harsh gun laws on California. To say nothing of Trump's ""take the guns first and due process second"" nonsense.

Trans rights? Lol no even when they had federal power the most they did was ""stop them from serving"" and even then it was more of a don't ask don't tell situation. (Which to be clear, is HORRIBLE, but hardly the level of damage they're capable of if they had wanted.)

It's all just bluster so they can personally enrich themselves and that kind mindset is baked into the ideology behind it.

They've convinced people that HIGHER WAGES are bad. You know, for anyone but themselves. That's how they push anti-union propaganda. If even ONE undeserving person gets more that takes away from ME.

They convinced people that lower taxes on the rich is good because of how it'll help the average person. Which makes zero sense.

To them, the CONCEPT of taxes is a crime.

"What? I never said anything like that but if you want we can talk about what people do after they make their guns.

42 % of households have a gun in the US. Around 91% own a car so we will triple gun statistics in order to compare and even put guns at a 30% disadvantage.

So JAMA estimates that including deaths,accidents,police shootings, etc we have around 120 thousand firearm injuries every year
 We will triple this to 360 thousand.

We know from the CDC there are around 6 million car accidents every year. This would mean that gun injuries when tripled around 6% as large a problem as car accidents. 

We can give guns more of a disadvantage and say injuries from car accidents which is around 3 million. That would it is 12%.

Comparing the problems and injuries caused by motor vehicles to those by guns just doesnt work out. Vehicles cause way way more harm, that is why we have those sorts of things.

"Actually we don’t know the recommendation, aside from vaguely wanting to add more justices. The commission would presumably be looking at actual details of how many to add, the reasons for why they should be added, and exactly how to go about it. 

For example, one argument I’ve seen is that reason SCOTUS currently has 9 justices is because there used to be 9 federal districts, but there are now 13. So hypothetically adding four justices would bring SCOTUS back in line with one justice per district.

There’s also been suggestions of having the seats be rotated among the federal judges. The Constitution mandates lifetime appointments for judges in general but doesn’t mandate that those judges have to sit on the same benches for their lifetime, so hypothetically it’s possible to have judges serve rotating, say, 6 year terms on SCOTUS. The commission could also be looking into something like that.

Finally while obviously the current Senate wouldn’t pass an expansion that doesn’t mean it’s not worthwhile to hash out details of a proposal that could get through further down the line.

"So only limiting magazine capacity had any possible effect though the Virginia tech shooting which used only 10 round mags was for a long time the deadliest mass shooting in the US.  And IIRC Columbine which happened during the AWB also only used 10 round mags but I could be mistaken there.

The largest logistical problem in regulating magazines is that a magazine is nothing more than a box with a spring and a small plate inside to push the rounds up.

Even the most simple 3D printer can crank these out like there is no tomorrow.  Combined with the fact that these items are not serial numbered nor stamped with any production date banning them will be exceedingly difficult bordering on impossible.  Most people who have them won't turn them in if a ban on them didn't include grandfathering.  A ban with grandfathering means newly made ones can be claimed to have been made before the ban and there is no way to prove that false.  And as I pointed out they are easier to make that growing pot and we all know how making pot illegal did nothing to stop it's use.

I actually heard a pretty compelling argument for dramatically increasing the number of justices to thirty. Basically they argued that adding more justices would decrease the partisan impact of losing or gaining a seat which would decrease the incentive to pull partisan BS. Also more opinions would push for more consensus within the court because you'd need a coalition in order to get to the majority. And you could do it so that the justices are added gradually over a period of time so one president isn't appointing 21 justices at a time.

"&gt;**Caitlyn Jenner, a former Olympian and prominent transgender activist, is  exploring a run for governor of California against Gov. Gavin Newsom**, a Democrat, who is facing a possible recall election later this year, according to people familiar with her thinking. She is  currently leaning toward running if an election is held, the people  said.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ms. Jenner, a longtime Republican, is being advised by Brad Parscale, Donald J. Trump’s former campaign manager**, according to a person  familiar with their discussions. Mr. Parscale would not manage Ms.  Jenner’s campaign but is guiding her on who to hire for key roles.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ms.  Jenner is also said to be working with Caroline Wren, a prominent  G.O.P. fund-raiser who was a senior adviser on the Trump presidential  campaign** last year and whose name was on a permit for events leading up to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. According to Axios, Ms. Wren  connected with Ms. Jenner through a Republican nonprofit working on  L.G.B.T.Q. issues.  
&gt;  
&gt;**The California  secretary of state is expected to announce soon that the Newsom recall effort has officially qualified for an election**; the recall organizers  say they have exceeded the 1.5 million signatures needed. Such an  election would likely be held later in the year.  
&gt;  
&gt;So  far, the effort to replace Mr. Newsom does not appear to mirror the  2003 recall election in California that ousted Gov. Gray Davis, a  Democrat, and elected Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican.

"[Florida lets citizens put amendments to the state constitution on the ballot if a petition gets enough signatures.](https://ballotpedia.org/Laws_governing_the_initiative_process_in_Florida)

Florida also has a law that says each law will be about one and only one subject:

&gt; [Every law shall embrace but one subject and matter properly connected therewith, and the subject shall be briefly expressed in the title.](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?submenu=3#A3S06)

And of course that applies to citizens' ballot initiatives.

Florida also has a [""constitution revision commission""](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Constitution_Revision_Commission), and it is the only state with such a body. The constitution revision commission can submit amendments directly to the ballot without a petition or signatures. Of the commission's 37 members, only one, [the State Attorney General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Moody), is elected.

The constitution revision commission is not bound by the law that requires each law to embrace one subject. They authored the notorious ""ban indoor vaping and offshore drilling?"" ballot question, which most people on all sides of both issues agreed should not have been ""bundled"" together.

&gt;[""Most of the commissioners are admittedly right-leaning. Given its makeup, the commission will likely be used to lock in conservative policies to the Constitution for a generation to come.""](https://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/what-the-hell-is-the-constitution-revision-commission/Content?oid=9962040)

Your personal incredulity is not an argument.

&gt; Plus, disenfranchising voters has a direct impact on the nation and its future. Making it a bit harder to get specific guns or gun add-ons does not.

Protecting the rights of all citizens regardless of race, creed, sex, or religion has a pretty important impact on the future of our nation.

"&gt;Greenberg and Gaetz are also connected on Venmo to at least one other woman that Greenberg paid with taxpayer funds using a government-issued credit card. Seminole County auditors flagged hundreds of those payments as “questioned or unaccounted for,” and in total found more than $300,000 in suspicious or unjustified expenses.
  
&gt;Last week, The New York Times reported that the Justice Department was investigating Gaetz for allegedly paying for a 17-year-old girl to travel with him across state lines and inducing her to have sex—an act that would violate federal child sex trafficking laws.

The biggest problem with our military is it’s inefficiently built and managed and not designed for what it seems the future of warfare is.  We need a much greater emphasis on training a smaller force of highly skilled special ops soldiers as opposed to the thousands of infantrymen we’re training or the 25 tanks a year we make despite not having used tanks in warfare since 2005.  The future of combat is sending special ops groups specially designed to complete a mission and less each side sending thousands of men to die against waves of enemies.  Cyber warfare is going to be super important in the future but to me it seems China and Russia are building their cyber military capabilities much quicker than america is.

I don't see that at all.  More often than not, Dem legislators are the first in line to attack Dems who screw up or do something morally or financially corrupt.

"Not defending the oil industry here but one huge overlooked reason for certain industries being subsidized, and why we’re now looking to subsidize domestic microchip manufacturing, is that these industries are essential to national defense. As in, if they are cut off during a war, we’re fucked. Two big ones, food and fuel. I guess they’re technically both fuel. 

Right now, the US military is the most expensive military in the world. Both in total spend and per capita. A lot of that is soldier pay, but the expensive equipment we have, the reason our jets cost so much is because our engineers and manufacturing employees are extremely well paid compared to their Chinese and Russian counterparts. So, if oil wasn’t subsidized, keeping costs artificially low, it would be too expensive to produce enough oil domestically. For a long time the US wasn’t a surplus oil producer. And now it is. Which is great for national security. But that ability came due to high fuel prices. With high prices and operating costs kept artificially low, domestic producers could afford to do things like fracking which is awful for the environment but great for the military. It means that if we piss off other oil producing countries (as most resistors want us to do. Saudi Arabia can fuck off) that it doesn’t matter if they cut off our oil supply. Domestic oil means no US war. 

Now, renewables are great, but the military doesn’t run off renewables. Yet. They were the first part of the federal government to seriously investigate and invest in electric vehicles. But for now, it’s fossil fuels. And if fossil fuels are expensive and not produced in America, it makes it harder for the military. 

So part of the considerations for removing or reducing subsidies is also whether the reduction in subsidies keeps enough domestic production online in order to satisfy military demand without bankrupting the country. 

Part of that means we need to bring online a ton of domestic lithium production online, secure sources of rare earth metals, get microchip production going here, and then we can get rid of oil subsidies. Once the military can wean itself off of oil, and go to electric or hydrogen or some other alternative fuel, we can do that.",1617982186.0,gtxv7vi,t3_mngbwb,/r/politics/comments/mngbwb/fossil_fuels_get_too_many_government_handouts/gtxv7vi/,1.0,1617996586.0,"oil, industry, reason, industries, microchip, manufacturing, defense, war, ones, food, fuel, t3_mngbwb, military, world, spend, capita, lot, soldier, equipment, jets, engineers, employees, counterparts, costs, time, producer, security, ability, prices, operating, producers, things, environment, countries, resistors, supply, renewables, part, government, vehicles, fuels, fossil, considerations, subsidies, reduction, production, order, demand, country, Part, ton, lithium, sources, earth, metals, electric, hydrogen",0.41424285714285725,0.0017333333333333385,0.0

It is divide and conquer. One of the reasons why I find affirmative action so problematic. While it helps to even out the impact of racial injustice it affirms racial boundaries (and allows others to complain).

"My point is more that this is a half-measure. One that I guarantee will have a few unintended consequences in a few years. 

Regardless, I’m all for making America safer. But here’s something to consider. Violent crime as a whole has been decreasing over the decades. Civilian market weapons technology hasn’t significantly changed since the about the 80s. 

So as a whole, fewer people are committing acts of violence, and the same weaponry has been available for a long time. But the number of mass shootings is creeping up, turning violent crime trends to being lower quantity and higher ‘quality’ in some cases. And at the same time reports of mental illness, especially untreated, has continued to increase.

I am not trying to dismiss gun control legislation by saying all of this. I hate that we’ve made it politicized to say it, but the fact is that America has a mental health crisis that may very well be the root cause of the issue. And each time we pass half-measure laws and lower our guard, it continues. Some of these people will turn to stabbings or improvised explosives or blunt force weaponry. And yay, they have a lower body count before the cops pump them full of lead.

"You're hearing it now because for the last two decades, the trend away from conservativism and Reagan-esc Republicanism has been getting stronger and stronger. The people do not want this bullshit anymore, and the Republicans are well aware their time is limited. 9/11 gave them a temporary respite against the shift but that has faded. Their old voter base is dying while two generations of staunchly progressive and dramatically more diverse voters have reached voting age and a third is in the oven. If it weren't for the obscene disproportionate representation of American democracy that takes power away from the population and gives it to vacant land, they'd be dead already.

They see the writing on the wall. They have for a long time. They know for the Republican Party to survive they have two options:

1. Change. Drop unpopular Reagan era policy, move closer to the center, eliminate racist platforms to appeal to all minorities, serve the people more than they serve the 1%.

2. Entrench. Do everything possible to corrupt democractic systems, undermine elections, gerrymand districts, cheat when and where possible, corrupt the judiciary with activist judges, feed endless propaganda to the masses, stoke racism and xenophobia to stop the hateful from ever siding with the enemy, exploit the broken American system of representation to prevent any and all reform that would make it easier to unseat them.

There is no possible way they will ever go with #1. Their racism alone forbids it, but so do their corporate overlords.  What you're seeing now is them ramping up #2 because Trump accelerated the shift to the left. He activated a generation of voters sooner than they usually would be, he send moderates running to the left to fight against him and his party. He absolutely destroyed the ""both sides"" fallacy that they have been able to hide behind since they 80s.

They only thing protecting them now is their propaganda machine and the fact racists will never forsake them, but that might not be enough in the long run.

Q    Yeah, I mean, is it the President’s belief that you do not have to undergo a background check when you are at a gun show?

" From the story, Michigan Governor asked for vaccines, and got tests and advice:

*""It will not include a “surge” of vaccine doses, a move Whitmer has advocated.  Instead, Biden outlined how the federal government was planning to help Michigan better administer the doses already allocated to the state, as well as surge testing capacity and drugs for virus treatment.""*

From what I have read, there is no shortage in Michigan of people who can give shots, there are simply not enough shots to go around. Testing is not a solution either. They are already testing, and guess what, people are sick, worse in the country rates. Even then, no favoritism for Whitmer, but the state could use some help based on the outbreak.

It makes it more difficult to obey the law because now if you wanted to own a pistol that utilizes a brace, which is about 4 million out in circulation- would in theory require you to pay 200$ per brace, and register with atf which is an extensive process that takes months, sometimes years.

"It's what's so damn aggravating about the tidal wave of vote suppression bills being introduced as a means to ""improve voter confidence,"" while going out of their way to ignore whenever anyone points out that election confidence amongst their constituents is down because they and their nothing king spent the year leading up, and the months following the election, literally berating them with the message that ""if Donald Trump loses, then the election is a fraud."" And pretty much refuse to even acknowledge the many election security bills that Mitch straightup refused to even bring to the floor for debate. 

The GQP refused to debate election security legislation in the Senate in the years leading up to the 2020 elections, saying they weren't necessary... then followed their loser's lead to hammer the narrative that if Biden wins, then clearly that will prove mass voter fraud in the election that they spent the years leading up to claiming zero need to enact legislation that would have prevented any of the fraud they then demanded we just accept. After over 60 failed lawsuits attempting to prove it (in which the leading prosecutor is currently trying to claim she can't be held accountable because she was lying the whole time), it turns out that their claims held as much water as a colander.

So basically they turned their heads in response to the 2016 elections, derailing and obstructing all investigations into the blatant as all fuck election interference, and mocking anybody upset over an election they never actually proved wasn't sickeningly questionable. Claiming the probe that they blocked as much evidence and avenues of investigation as possible - ie ratfucked to fail - vindicated their dear leader (it didn't, and kinda did the exact opposite, but those are just silly details). All because their guy won. But when the next election came around, and their guy lost them the executive AND legislative branches, ***now*** is the time to look into election security. And no need to question their doing this after already attempting a violent insurrection to take the government, due to an election to so unfairly didn't win.

**TL;DR** - Glaringly coordinated election interference and fraud leading to their win? Nothing to see here. No need to ensure election security. But the following election with the highest voter turnout, despite a global health crisis, without a hint of any *actual* fraud/interference/tampering, that somehow led to their loss? Clearly it was rigged against them, their proof being their biggest loser claiming if he lost, then it was rigged against them. 

I mean, it's not like they didn't spend 4 years aggressively pissing off/hurting/embarrassing as many Americans as possible that could have led to their big L, or anything like that. Or wait, no, that's exactly what happened. And they're ***still*** trying to act all high and mighty, as fanatical conspiratorial lunacy completely engulfs their party and everything they claim to stand for. 

***Still TL;DR:*** 
&gt;We cheated and won, get over it losers. All of that proof isn't proof.

Uh, yeah, he did. There were numerous lawsuits that would throw out entire counties worth of votes over things like a higher percentage of mismatched signatures.

In the end he attempted to throw out entire states, mine included, overturning millions of legally cast ballots.

He turned down a deal that would have given him 25 billion up front for his wall.

Most retailers probably can't do much more to curb illegal purchases, either.

"If you have the mental maturity and psychological fortitude to know exactly what you're getting out of it vs. what you're giving away and not let it affect your self worth, character, and value, then it sounds like easy money to me.

First, impeachment is inherently political, making the idea of impartial jurors inapplicable. Second, you seem to be conceding there is no rule of the Senate which was violated.

You confuse hypocrisy with nuance. Nuance is what keeps us from saying ""Anyone who kills another shall be put to death, no exceptions"" and instead ""Anyone who kills another shall be put to death, unless such was done so in defense of either their own life or the life of another from a clear, present, and reasonable danger.""

I don't see Gaetz resigning even if he's indicted. Both Hunter and Collins were re-elected after they were indicted.

"Well you recalled wrong lol, look through my comments I never said anything up to this point about what happens when you lower the rates except that it doesn’t guarantee lower prices and higher wages. Same as how increasing corporate taxes does not guarantee higher prices and lower wages, but the data I have shown suggests that thats what happens.

You are right though, I misinterpreted tax incidence, and it does apply both ways. So the studies I have looked at actually seem to indicate that lowering the corporate tax rate has had a fairly large benefit to consumers and laborers. I was wrong there, and it does apply both ways.

You can argue that there is no evidence that raising or lowering the rate has no effect on my data points. I can argue that there is, such as the study that I posted the research brief for in my earlier comments.

You’re right that can be argued for any liability, but that doesn’t diminish the point at all. If increasing liabilities already disproportionately affects small corporations, then the corporate tax would hurt their productivity even if everyone paid the same proportion. Combined with the massive issues we fave with tax avoidance, you’re putting a liability on small business that isn’t having nearly the same effect on many large ones. This gives large corporations a significant advantage over smaller competitors, which in my opinion is not something we as a nation should want. There are other ways to increase our tax revenue without putting excess burden on small business. We can establish a minimum corporate tax, or work to close tax loophole and still increase our tax revenue without the regressive effects of hiking the corporate tax.",1617979143.0,gtxoe2z,t1_gtxl70m,/r/politics/comments/mmtdl0/top_us_ceos_open_to_corporate_tax_rate_of_28/gtxoe2z/,1.0,1617993543.0,"lol, comments, point, rates, prices, wages, taxes, data, tax, incidence, ways, studies, rate, benefit, consumers, laborers, evidence, effect, points, study, research, brief, liability, liabilities, corporations, productivity, proportion, issues, avoidance, business, ones, advantage, competitors, opinion, nation, revenue, burden, loophole, effects",0.40372503840245777,0.05207373271889401,0.0

"Saying both sides are the same is like insisting murder is just as bad as stealing a pack of gum from a gas station. Yeah, they're both crimes and immoral. But one is SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE AND MORE HARMFUL.

It's intellectually lazy blustering to lump both parties together. 

And here's the thing with the kids in cages: Trump basically fucked every corner of the government up in ways that will take decades to fix. Biden entered the job on day one having to triage and put out a ton of fires. 


It's almost guaranteed that he has been working nonstop on as many fronts as possible to stop the bleeding in as many crucial areas as possible, but take it from someone who has literally worked in federal government in some capacity since she was 17: it is WAY EASIER to break something than to fix it around here. It's also quicker. It will take decades to fix and even then... some of this stuff is irreparable. 

When Trump fucked up immigration and border control, he did things that crippled the mechanisms that would be needed to turn it around. He stacked agencies with loyalists, he fired personnel that stood up to him, he defunded offices responsible for oversight and re-allocated budget to his racist gestapo, and rewarded those bad actors for being ruthless. 

Biden, who is trying to repair everything at once... is constrained by laws and regulations where Trump was not. He can't just open the doors and let the kids leave, many are underage. Some can't even talk. Some are so ill that they can't travel. Most, there are no records or contact information for parents. We don't even know who these kids belong to in most instances because Trump INSTRUCTED HIS PEOPLE NOT TO KEEP RECORDS. They were ripping kids from their parents who weren't old enough to know their own name, and didn't record who they belong to.

And there are THOUSANDS of them.

What Biden IS doing... is opening more facilities to house these poor kids in limbo, he's improving the conditions they're in so that they can at least be comfortable and secure while their family is found (hopefully). This will take years to fix. He hasn't forgotten about them, and you insisting without nuance and critical thinking that he's just as bad as Trump is nonsense.

Trump left him the largest mess anyone ever has for an incoming President. If you're so concerned, I sure hope you donate regularly to the ACLU, since they were the ones busting their asses to fight and fix this from the start, and are now instrumental in helping reunite families.

"I made my wish list about 2-3 years ago and I'm seeing similar trends in the firearms community supporting these kinds of measures .Instead of focusing on the same tired ineffective gun policies focus on social policies, I suggest:

* Comprehensive Mental Health Care reform with an emphasis on suicide prevention and increasing access and availability of support and counselling.
* Create a nationally funded suicide hotline for immediate counseling and advertise it heavily through radio, TV, billboard, and internet ads.
* Create a CDC suicide prevention task force to have small groups of mental health professionals go around the country providing free counseling, mental health evaluations, and support.
* Create education subsidies and grants for those pursuing careers in the mental health field that agree to spend a designated time after graduation working in rural communities. There are similar programs for medical doctors.
* Launch a comprehensive CDC study of common psychological drugs to determine potential risks for violent behavior associated with their use.
* Create a national program to temporarily surrender your firearms at any police station for 72 hours.
* Federal Tax credits for gun safes and annual gun safety courses.
* Real gun safety education elective courses in high school, like drivers ed.
* Legalize and regulate marijuana in America in the style of alcohol. Apply a 20% tax rate with all tax revenues ear marked for education in the zip code collected.
* Create a national work program focused on rebuilding the crumbling infrastructure in America with a recruiting campaign targeting low income high crime areas.
* Federally mandate all uniformed peace officers and agents to have an active body cam during working hours.
* Create a federal FBI task force to independently investigate all police shootings and determine their validity.
* Disband the ATF and give their duties to the FBI with increased funding.
* Enact and enforce mandatory minimums, 10 year per gun and 1 year per bullet, for all prohibited persons found guilty of committing a property or violent crime with an illegally possessed firearms unless they cooperate with investigators to identify and testify against who supplied them the illegal guns and ammunition.

First, most gun violence is suicide.  70% of the reported annual gun deaths in the country are suicides.

20% is made up of gang activity mostly related to the drug black market.  This is where you might find gun without serial numbers and maybe ghosts guns.

The remaining 10% is accidents, domestic violence, mass shootings, and random crime.  Most of these involve a legally purchased firearm that involved a background check, screening, and/or waiting period.

Ghost guns mostly belong to non-violent gun collectors and tech nerds.

"Ever since this ""child separation"" shit began I've got the suspicion they were being trafficked.  Children are always the canary in the mine.  We talk a lot about how we care about kids but we just don't.  We cut funding for education, SNAP, WIC, their healthcare, and anything else we can the second we want to build a bigger bomb.  They are always the lowest on the totem pole.  This is evident in the fact that it wasn't even that long ago it was legal to kill your own children.  In any household they are a litmus test for how well the family is doing in general and this extends to the country as a whole.  It's not just America, either.  This is the whole world.  We're shitty to kids.  And the only reason someone would expend the kind of time, energy, and money on marginalizing them in that way - literally taking them from their parents - is if they want them marginalized for... Reasons.  There's no way our government spent all that money to just be mean without expecting a monetary return when they could've saved fuck tons just by dumping them back over the border.  They were making money off those kids somehow.  There had to be a $$$ bottom line because no one actually cares that much about anything to just waste that much money making a point.  Then think of all the children who have been ""lost"" in the system.  They're not lost.  They're probably scrubbing toilets somewhere in Dubai or something far worse.  Governments don't just throw money away on kids like that to make a point that could just as easily been made by dumping them over the border.

"You don't even need to look that far for a comparison. Forget comparing to Switzerland, a small European country with a predominantly homogeneous population. Canada is right next door and probably the country the most similar to the USA in the world.

Canadians are also one of the most armed people on the planet, 7th in gun ownership by capita with 34.7 guns per 100 inhabitants.   


Culturally, Canada and the USA are very similar. Canada has a much more robust system of Gun Control, with a required safety course, and criminal check via the RCMP to own firearms. Im sure some small cultural differences account for some differences as well, but I believe the gun control measures and the more robust healthcare system/universal system in Canada truly account for the vast difference.   


Just reading this article is eye opening on the issue: [https://globalnews.ca/news/2378037/gun-violence-by-the-numbers-how-america-canada-and-the-world-compare/](https://globalnews.ca/news/2378037/gun-violence-by-the-numbers-how-america-canada-and-the-world-compare/)

Think how hard it is for the government to do anything currently like repair a road.

"Haha okay yeah you are really lost and not understanding this so I will be clearer. I understand civics; federations are bad. States are not real. You can claim that states internally have their own history and culture but you are surely aware that the average person in Manhattan has a lot more in common with the average Seattle resident than they do with people from say Allegany County, NY. 

Your belief that CA, TX and NY would become overlords is obviously nonsensical and it's something you types say when we talk about removing the Electoral College. Those 3 states are not monoliths, and do not even vote together (yet). Texas is not going to be in a compact with California and New York to dominate the senate. California and NY are not monoliths of liberalism. They have a large number of conservatives as well, literally millions.

The senate is just like the electoral college - it's a way to make some people's votes matter a lot more than others based on where they live. It is therefore inherently undemocratic. The biggest point really is if California, NY and Texas did vote as a monolith, and use their large populations effectively to decide policy... why would that be bad in your mind?! Policy in the senate is controlled by someone at any time. Right now, the policy for the whole country is largely controlled by one guy from West Virginia.

"Try to remember when the novel was written. World War II had recently ended. The Red Menace was everywhere, people were afraid of nuclear war. A strong military was not only looked upon favorably, but was considered essential. Which is pretty much how it is portrayed in the book. It was a war for survival, us or the bugs. Hard to be pacifist about that. Rico had his home city bombed and all of his family killed. 

The point of the novel was not so much that the military was the solution to all of society's problems, but rather that if you aren't an active participant in society then you shouldn't have a say in how it is run. Serving earns you the franchise - and there were options for those who couldn't be soldiers too. Civil service counted for example. The idea being that you can best understand how to improve society by serving it is not an entirely bad one. We consider voting to be a right, given to us at birth. Heinlein was asking what the world would look like if you had to earn that right. How much more would you value the privilege?

Heinlein wasn't a fascist, but certainly thought that military service made people better. Today we celebrate veterans and thank them for their service.

"I put scare quotes on 'free' specifically because it's not free; it comes from rich people to start. 

In the future robots will absolutely have the precision to cut granite countertops. Sure, specialized positions like doctor and vaccine research will likely not be done entirely by machine, but you're catching on that basic any service, manual labor, factory, etc. job will eventually be done by machines.

UBI *does* solve that problem, not only because the alternative is just letting people starve to death. How do you run out of rich people? The amount of money in the system doesn't have to decrease (it doesn't really have to do anything since money is made-up/imaginary), so if there are 5 trillion dollars circulating, there will still be 5 trillion dollars circulating if we take 4 trillion from the super rich and spread it out among everyone else. 

In an ideal world, we would have a socialist system where we all as Americans own socialized versions of Amazon, Netflix, etc. Whenever anyone used those services, the money they pay in would then become UBI to all of us.

"It’s not that California couldn’t theoretically be an independent nation; it’s more that it current lacks much of the infrastructure necessary to do so effectively, due to its long dependence on federal institutions. Brexit was bad enough when an already independent nation left the European Union. But the U.K. was always more independent from the E.U. than California is from the federal government. California secession would be the unilateral dismantling of *every* federal program in the state.

It has no standing army. No navy. No Air Force. No independent control over its currency. No federal reserve of its own. California courts could not handle the influx of cases caused by the removal of the federal court system. All federal programs would come to a screeching halt. Medicaid? Gone. Medicare? Gone. No more federal food stamps/SNAP benefits.Thousands will die while California tries to get its act together. Federal funding for roads, bridges, transit, and other infrastructure? No more. No more help from the FBI. No CIA. No ICE. No more federal prosectution of dangerous crimes. No more federal *law* of any kind—so the California legislature better get busy filling all of those legal holes! No more constitutional rights, so California better get busy making sure it’s state constitution is sufficient (it probably isn’t in its current state). No more federal student loans, so thousands of students are getting kicked out of college for failure to pay. California would need its own State Department (the federal kind—for foreign diplomacy). It would need to instal checkpoints at its borders with other states, which are now completely separate countries. It would need its own passports. And it could not use federal agents, federal agencies, or federal money to do so. There are thousands of federal programs and agencies that California has become reliant on over time. This is no longer the 1800s, when government was much smaller. The rise of the administrative state makes secession a much more dicey proposition.

You maybe have heard that California pays more money in federal taxes than it receives in federal benefits. First, [that’s no longer true](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/California-no-longer-pays-more-to-Washington-than-15243861.php). Second, because of the economies of scale, even if it were true, taxes in California would need to increase to cover the removal of all of these federal benefits. Trade disruption would be enormous—worse than Brexit. The United States would have the upper hand in any trade negotiations. Corporations would flee the state en masse, only exacerbating the issue of state funding and taxation. And all of this is assuming the United States willingly allows California to secede. The United States has no reason to do this. It is unconstitutional for a state to secede. Any attempted secession would be extremely unpopular. The United States has the world’s most powerful military; the California has what, the state-level national guard? If you’re talking about secession and a Civil War 2.0, the federal government and military have become so much more powerful since the mid 1800s that things would be over before they’d even begun.

So yes, secession is not only unrealistic, but a completely ridiculous notion. Brexit was already bad enough, and it involved a country *that already had most of these thing in place!* Could California theoretically recreate all of this federal infrastructure for itself? Sure. But forget the easy life that comes with being part of the most powerful military force and most important trading market in the world. Even if California could recreate these systems, it would  take a long, long time—and it simply would not be worth it. In the meantime, there would be destruction: poverty, violence, potentially war.

"I'm a lifelong Democrat, and I am not helping the Republicans with a false equivalency. State legislatures do redistricting. In 2020, the GOP won down-ballot, and now they are trying to use that to their advantage. They have control of state legislatures because people believed if they voted for Biden, then they had to vote Republican down-ballot to ensure the system was ""fair."" That is a great idea, but what ends up happening is gridlock. Similar gridlock happened in 2011, and it's about to happen again in 2021, just as the GOP wants. The best way to solve this issue is by creating guidelines to make re-districting more bi-partisan. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, In the 2020 election, Biden won Arizona, but Republicans won down-ballot and maintained control over the state Senate. If it weren't for a bi-partisan redistricting committee, the state legislature could re-draw their districts to dilute just enough Democrat votes to make sure they win the entire ticket for the next ten years. [Here is a 538 podcast with how that works.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-gerrymandering-project/) But Arizona's Constitution requires a bi-partisan committee to make districts. Next month, instead of the state legislature assigning 5 Republicans to re-draw the lines, we have 2 Democrats, 2 Republicans, and 1 independent.  [Look who opposed efforts to make re-districting fair in Arizona](https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona_Creation_of_a_Redistricting_Commission,_Proposition_106_(2000)) last decade. It was the Republicans that sued and took it to the Supreme Court. They are against bi-partisan districting committees because they know a fair redistricting process puts them at a disadvantage.

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to end gerrymandering, you have to frame the argument, so regular voters see redistricting as a fair and competitive process. Americans love competition, and by selling it as such, you take away the GOP's power to gerrymander by racial lines. Historically, gerrymandering has pros and cons, and it's beneficial to discuss all aspects of it, especially as Americans continue to group themselves by moving to areas with like-minded people.

"&gt; Jordan Sather

I know that name. Years and years ago (2014) my partner took me to a wedding in East Texas. He was officiating it. The people getting married were a college friend of his who was 2nd generation Russian - he had a PhD in infrared microscopy (physics). The woman was named Teresa. She was 10 years younger and very pretty. Not bright, but very pretty. 

I drank a bit much and had a crummy time, I don't love Texas. 

A couple years later on social media I realize these two weren't probably together anymore, but the reason was the woman, Teresa, had started adopting an alien disclosure guru persona and was trying to get YouTube followers.

And she was dating this guy, Jordan Sather.

That must have been a real kick in the teeth for my partner's college buddy, who was a really real physicist, but also kind of an incel. He was just kind of geeky, and for all his looney Jordan Sather was there on YouTube parading around with his wife. Oops.

"""Now, 53 years later, his daughter, Bernice A. King, is calling on Georgia corporations to uphold the pledges they made in 2020 in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. An open letter jointly penned by King, Al Vivian, and John-Miles Lewis, states that in the run-up to the omnibus bill’s passage, “Corporations did not go far enough to ensure every voting citizen had fair and equitable access to the most basic of American rights – the right to participate in the electoral process; the right to have a voice in our shared future. The failure of corporate leaders across our state to live up to their racial equity commitments made in the last year disregards and disrespects our fathers' tireless work and jeopardizes the soul of Georgia and the promise of democracy. . . . when the first test came challenging our corporations to move from words to action, to stand on behalf of disenfranchised voters, there was shocking silence. . . .

"I mean there are 100% upstanding Republican candidates.   


But as a party their focus isn't typically on spreading their ideas and rallying their base.   
Instead the focus is on changing the voters, purging rolls if it might favor them, making it more difficult and ensuring that voting is a process instead of an automatic part of any other process.   


Democrats are certainly also gerrymandering but not to the level that Republicans have in the last decade or so.

I'm a 2A supporter and I would only agree to universal Healthcare if we fixed our overpriced Healthcare system first and if it was well thought out.  Drug companies need to be put in their place with their monopolized pricing. We also need to determine what would be free and what would still be paid for with universal Healthcare. I dont agree with free cosmetic surgeries like liposuction or even things like free transition sugery/therapy. There are also a lot of people who have no care in the world for their own health and I don't feel comfortable paying higher taxes for them to have free health care. If they want free Healthcare they should be able to pass a PE test or somehow prove they are trying to take care of themselves. Another large issue is scheduling. It already takes maybe 3 weeks to get to see a doctor or schedule a procedure. Now imagine if everybody had the ability to get these things done for free. Then the wait time could triple. Imagine needing a life changing surgery and they tell you the wait list is 4 months.,1617974467.0,gtxejmk,t1_gtu1rrj,/r/politics/comments/mmwqq4/megathread_president_joseph_biden_announces/gtxejmk/,1.0,1617988867.0,"supporter, t1_gtu1rrj, system, Drug, companies, place, pricing, surgeries, liposuction, things, transition, sugery, therapy, lot, people, care, world, health, taxes, test, issue, weeks, doctor, procedure, ability, time, life, surgery, wait, list, months",0.6054315476190476,0.29464285714285715,0.0

"No, not really. We have built up this economy for over a century since the Spanish American War and continued doubling down with the world wars. This budget produces millions of well paying jobs a lot from defense contractors. VA, DC and MD would be a hellscape as all of the high paying jobs vanish and all of the families who have built their lives for decades around this would be out on their ass. Not too mention all of the businesses and restaurants dependent on these people with disposable income to help keep them afloat.

Redirecting defense contractors and pentagon budgets to more fruitful ventures is the right move. Most of the people that work for defense contractors are incredibly talented and intelligent people that have nothing to do with producing or creating deadly weapons/conflict. They are engineers that otherwise would not be able to find a job in their field. 

The reality is that eliminating defense spending without redirecting that workforce would result in a complete economic collapse. This is what fuels the never ending wars post-WW2. Funny enough it is the same base principles as socialism but only applied to killing other people. 

Odd that we never formed a Department of Peace where we could utilize these people for other ventures like making the world a better place, employing more diplomacy, and utilizing service members in the military to build infrastructure and provide vital resources to unstable regions. I feel like more positive outcomes would come from that than going to war creating more hate and animosity.

"&gt; Creationism is blatantly false, even to Christians. Intelligent Design Theory absolutely SHOULD be taught alongside macro evolution since it's a viable theory that accounts for scientific discoveries.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It's REALLY important not to confuse those two, which apparently Arkansas has now done...


First, that's just wrong about Christians and Creationism.  Claiming no Christians believe in creationism is absurd; [sure they do](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/06/how-highly-religious-americans-view-evolution-depends-on-how-theyre-asked-about-it/).

That said, Creationism and Intelligent Design are indeed different.  Creationism means no evolution.  Intelligent Design includes evolution.  However, Intelligent Design is, as someone already pointed out, not a scientific theory.  It essentially relies on the lack of evidence as evidence.  Complex structures, like insect wings and eyes, are used as examples of ""irreducibly complex"" aspects of evolution that we can't explain.  How did A-&gt;C when we don't know B (or maybe lack even have good guesses on B) and answer that with ""God.""  And of course, the origin of the simplest, earliest microbial life.

What struck me here was the ""macro evolution"" bit as being in opposition to ID.  ID proponents kind of have to believe in ""macro evolution"" which is just evolution over long time scales and more evolutionary changes.  Otherwise, for example, you have to toss out some half billion years of fossil record and the clear increases in complexity.

Intelligent Design is not a scientific theory.  It is a way to make room for God for people that want to believe God had a hand in our creation.  But, with that room, to also to not have to disregard some much evolutionary evidence, evidence that just continues to grow.",1617974155.0,gtxdxk1,t1_gtvjegm,/r/politics/comments/mn191w/creationism_can_be_taught_as_science_in_arkansas/gtxdxk1/,1.0,1617988555.0,"gt, t1_gtvjegm, evolution, theory, discoveries, creationism, fact, tank/2019/02/06, americans, view, theyre, lack, evidence, structures, insect, wings, eyes, examples, aspects, B, guesses, course, origin, life, bit, opposition, proponents, time, scales, changes, example, years, fossil, record, increases, complexity, way, room, people, hand, creation",0.638425925925926,0.2201388888888889,0.0

"Same. I understand the sentiment, but these are just people too. For every one of these idiots tumbling down the rabbit hole, there's probably a whole bunch of onlookers (partner, siblings, parents, children, colleagues, friends...)  who are watching a loved one fall victim to manipulation and scams. 

Many of the people who fall for these conspiracies and lies are struggling with problems of their own to begin with. A big part of the reason why some turn to these conspiratorial hoaxes is because it gives them a sense of power and security back. It's a way of making sense of an unpredictable and unfair world. Dealing with sorrow, doubt, regret and a bleak future becomes a lot more manageable when you can pin it on a single enemy (""they"") who's to blame for your problems and excuses your shortcomings. 

The reason you lost your job doesn't have anything to do with you, nor is it an indictment of a deeply unequal and unsustainable model of growth. No, it's because they are doing this! The globalists, the leftists, the communists, the UN are eroding your values and giving your hard-earned job to illegal immigrants! And now that you've accepted this, you're officially ""in the know"" and see through this veil that deceives the other sheeple. Sure, they might be more successful than you are, but they're just pawns while you see the truth and trust those who dare ""say it as it is"" to find a solution.

So while I can to a certain extent sympathize with the reaction of ""they had it coming"" (as there's a lot of truth to that), it's not something we should revel in. I've seen people I cared about go down this rabbit hole. They burned bridges, ruined relationships, broke families and caused massive damage to their own lives, all while a lot of bystanders tried to help and stop it to no avail.

&gt; MIAMI - Former Republican Sen. Frank Artiles was in possession of campaign documents of two spoiler no-party candidates who ran in separate, competitive Miami-Dade state Senate races in 2020, according to a 38-page search warrant obtained by the Miami Herald Thursday.

&gt; The 2020 election cycle drew three mysterious no-party candidates in contentious and expensive Senate races - Districts 37 and 39 in Miami-Dade and District 9 in Central Florida - all won by Republicans.

&gt; Former senator Artiles, no-party candidate face new charges in spoiler election scheme.

"&gt; The person who was shot was literally trying to climb through a window into the Speaker's Lobby, which was locked and barricaded from the inside.

That doesn't conflict with anything I said

&gt; Nobody just happened to succumb to heart disease during the January 6th riot as if by pure coincidence.

Just like nobody just happened to succumb to a drug overdose? There were a lot of people there who were worried about their country being stolen through a fraudulent election that still hasn't been satisfactorily investigated in the light of other countries also having fraudulent elections due to the presence of nothing more than vans filled with pre-marked ballots of which we had plenty of uninvestigated vans and other oddities that happened when nobody was even allowed to observe

You have just as much justification in saying 'nobody just happened to succumb to heart disease' as I do in saying 'they both just happened to succumb to heart disease'. In fact, heart disease being the #1 killer in the US and also being more prevalent in December/January makes it even more likely- but you want conservatives to be the bad side in every possible scenario so I'm sure it's water off your back

As far as fact-checking goes, going to pass on what you linked. Snopes is infamous for saying something is false and then simply (even then, not always) rewording the 'false statement' to say what really happened later on in the article. Snopes is a curated, anti-wrongthink website run by a grand total of two people (it is/was a couple) who thought their politics should be all anyone believes. Not sure about politifact, don't really care- you only need to see 'wrongthink' punished once to view the whole 'factchecking' field in a dim view.

https://imgur.com/a/bD3lvq2

The fact is that BLM activists have been killing people. I watched them kill a Trump supporter on video myself. Just like you say 'nobody just happened to succumb to heart disease', I'll say '36 people didn't just happen to randomly die to violent wounds during the BLM rioting season'- which your wrongthink checkers purport.

&gt; If you divide the BLM protest-related casualties by the number of individual locations and days, they come out as massively less violent and harmful than the 5 deaths and dozens of injuries from January 6th.

The last thing I thought I'd ever see in my life is a 'bleeding-heart leftist' trying to justify deaths through a cold mathematical equation.

"How about the Tucker/Blackstone legal texts from 1803.

&gt;A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep, and bear arms, shall not be infringed. Amendments to C. U. S. Art. 4. This may be considered as the true palladium of liberty ... The right of self defence is the first law of nature: In most governments it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible. Wherever standing armies are kept up, and the right of the people to keep and bear arms is, under any colour or pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction. In England, the people have been disarmed, generally, under the specious pretext of preserving the game : a never failing lure to bring over the landed aristocracy to support any measure, under that mask, though calculated for very different purposes. True it is, their bill of rights seems at first view to counteract this policy: but the right of bearing arms is confined to protestants, and the words suitable to their condition and degree, have been interpreted to authorise the prohibition of keeping a gun or other engine for the destruction of game, to any farmer, or inferior tradesman, or other person not qualified to kill game. So that not one man in five hundred can keep a gun in his house without being subject to a penalty.

Tucker was perhaps the first constitution al scholar and the tucker annotated Blackstone text was an essential legal text for practicing attorneys in the states.


How about 1825 Willian Rawle. In his book. A view of the constitution of the united states of america.

&gt;The prohibition is general. No clause in the Constitution could by any rule of construction be conceived to give to congress a power to disarm the people. Such a flagitious attempt could only be made under some general pretence by a state legislature. But if in any blind pursuit of inordinate power, either should attempt it, this amendment may be appealed to as a restraint on both.


Or my favorite Judge Thomas J Cooley.

&gt;It might be supposed from the phraseology of this provision that the right to keep and bear arms was only guaranteed to the militia; but this would be an interpretation not warranted by the intent. The militia, as has been elsewhere explained, consists of those persons who, under the law, are liable to the performance of military duty, and are officered and enrolled for service when called upon. But the law may make provision for the enrolment of all who are fit to perform military duty, or of a small number only, or it may wholly omit to make any provision at all; and if the right were limited to those enrolled, the purpose of this guaranty might be defeated altogether by the action or neglect to act of the government it was meant to hold in check. The meaning of the provision undoubtedly is, that the people, from whom the militia must be taken, shall have the right to keep and bear arms; and they need no permission or regulation of law for the purpose.",1617972391.0,gtxam5s,t1_gtwhpkc,/r/politics/comments/mmwqq4/megathread_president_joseph_biden_announces/gtxam5s/,1.0,1617986791.0,"t1_gtwhpkc, texts, militia, security, state, right, people, arms, Amendments, Art, palladium, liberty, self, defence, law, nature, governments, study, rulers, limits, armies, colour, brink, destruction, pretext, game, lure, aristocracy, measure, mask, purposes, bill, rights, view, policy, protestants, words, condition, degree, prohibition, gun, engine, farmer, tradesman, person, man, house, penalty, constitution, scholar, tucker, text, attorneys, states, book, america, clause, rule, construction, power, attempt, pretence, legislature, pursuit, amendment, restraint, phraseology, provision, interpretation, intent, persons, performance, duty, service, enrolment, number, purpose, guaranty, action, neglect, government, check, meaning, permission, regulation",0.5183766233766234,0.09085497835497833,0.0

"Frank Artiles ran a fake candidate in [a Miami-Dade Florida race in 2020](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article249999979.html).

Then he bragged about it at the election night party for Jason Brodeur.

&gt; **“That is me, that was all me,”** Artiles told a crowd at Liam Fitzpatrick’s restaurant in Lake Mary, where *Sen. Jason Brodeur* was holding his election night party, according to a person who was there and who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation.

&amp;nbsp;

Jason Brodeur won his race by beating Patricia Sigman.

Patricia Sigman lost partly because [a fake Liberal opponent](https://www.wwnytv.com/2020/11/24/ghost-candidates-blamed-siphoning-votes-florida-senate-races/), Jestine Ianotti, also ran - that pulled votes from Sigman. 

So Artiles is interferring in an election. Then he shows up at the victory party for Jason Brodeur, who benefited from very similar election interference.

&amp;nbsp;

And now we learn that [Matt Gaetz](https://www.businessinsider.com/feds-investigating-matt-gaetz-sham-candidate-florida-elections-nyt-2021-4), who is from another district way up north, was involved.

&gt;The Times reported that investigators were told about a conversation in which Gaetz and Chris Dorworth, a prominent Florida lobbyist, discussed running a fake third candidate to siphon votes off Sigman and boost Brodeur's chances of winning.

"Lol that's ridiculous, personally I find her abhorrent/unattractive but still that's a bizarre claim. How has an adult making adult porn for adults normalised sexualising kids? Because she looks young? So that's subjective firstly - if you said she looked 16 and I said she looked 20, neither one of us are right, that's just our opinion.

It also seems like a massive stretch to imagine that people who are fine jerking it to a legal age women are secretly wishing she was younger just for the sake of it. I'm assuming there are quite a few people out there who like it specifically because it's legal and no-one is getting hurt (YMMV but assuming the porn is ethically produced, yeah).

Fetishizing kids has grown notably less and less acceptable. Papers in the UK were publishing topless images of 16 year olds as recently as the 90's, for example. Pornhub and other sites recently nuked like 2/3 of their content because of lack of verification.

&gt; Just months after dozens of QAnon followers took part in the Capitol insurrection, two major GOP figures are attending a huge QAnon conference in Dallas.

&gt; Despite having a speaker lineup stacked with QAnon influencers, the event&amp;#039;s website doesn&amp;#039;t have a single mention of QAnon-and the organizer, John Sabal, claims the event isn&amp;#039;t a QAnon conference.

&gt; While Dallas city officials don&amp;#039;t seem too concerned about a QAnon influx to the city next month, some residents are, and they&amp;#039;re attempting to get the event cancelled.

&gt; Federal prosecutors investigating Rep. Matt Gaetz over sex-trafficking allegations are also considering whether he talked about running a fake candidate in a Florida Senate election to skew the results, The New York Times reported.

&gt; In November, the GOP candidate Jason Brodeur, an associate of Gaetz, beat the Democratic candidate Patricia Sigman to win a seat in the state Senate.

&gt; The Times reported that investigators were told about a conversation in which Gaetz and Chris Dorworth, a prominent Florida lobbyist, discussed running a fake third candidate to siphon votes off Sigman and boost Brodeur&amp;#039;s chances of winning.

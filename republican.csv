alright, so final scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

Trump won and it's unknown as to whether it was fair or if there was fraud involved. but to most republicans, it's believed to be fair. However, it's the middle of January, and you're sitting at home and hear about democrats and Biden supporters raiding the capitol building. republican news outlets such as Fox and others are claiming that Biden incited an attack to stop the democratic process and that democrats were claiming voter fraud occurred. (basically a role reversal once again, same severity and the same reason for the raid. except to the world, it's unknown whether fraud happened and both sides think opposite of the other). 

&amp;#x200B;

would the people raiding, by your standards, be considered patriotic? they don't know for sure if voter fraud happened but they believe it, and the right believes that it was a fair election.  


As well, in this scenario, what would you be thinking? would you still think that it'd be justified for the raid? or would you believe that it was a horrible act that should be punished?

"alright, second to last one I swear. after you reply to this I have one more then we're done.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say that what happened at the capital occurred, Biden won and republicans and trump supporters raided the capital. except this time, there was, in reality, no voter fraud. Their reasons stay the same, they believe there was voter fraud, but there is no proof and factually it didn't happen. now as usual, for the roles to reverse. Trump won fairly, no voter fraud and nothing. however, democrats and Biden supporters raid the capital believing and insisting that there was voter fraud when in reality there was none. Equal scenario, equal reasoning, both raid to the same severity for something they both believe to be true when in reality it's false.  


from what I've gathered you'd say it's equal since the severity and reasons are the same. and I do want it confirmed whether I'm correct in my assumption, but my main question is whether either side is being patriotic, which I believe I know your answer but want to make sure.

"Not sure why the tangent was necessary, let’s stick to the topic:

The polls were “wrong” in that they found Hillary Clinton *likely* to win a number of States that, had she taken most of them, would have given her a “landslide” win.  Trump’s path to victory (let alone landslide) was extremely narrow and therefore, unlikely.

In fact, many States pollsters believed were likely Clinton were in fact toss-ups.  Miraculously, Trump won most of those States like WI, PA, FL, MI... and won the election.

Many of those close states he won with FAR fewer votes than Joe Biden did vs Trump.

Up until election night the media and the polls showed Clinton was going to win in a landslide and Trump was going to lose. Maybe the fact that after the election they even admitted that the polls were wrong and not accurate. No Trump had people fed up with the previous administration and they made that known. The media and democrats spent the next 4 years on a smear campaign to ruin trumps 2020 chances of winning. Two failed impeachments over nothing and countless lies and over exaggerations of the truth over that time frame. This joke of an administration we have now is already proving to be the wrong decision for America and everyone is and will come to see that.

"Well see he is wrong but also right.

 There are circumstances.  Is the gun show only with FFL dealers and no private dealers? If yes, he is wrong.   you are 100% getting a background check as Licensed sellers are mandated to check ID, keep documentations, bill of sales, and perform background checks.

Are private sellers allowed at the gun show? If yes, a private seller is NOT required by law to check ID, keep documentations and perform background checks.

Private sales states that the seller shouldn't sell to the buyer if they BELIEVE there is no reasons for them to posses a firearm.

Private sellers are also encouraged to check ID but if dont, encouraged to use a FFL to transfer firearms. Nothing here states the private seller by law has to check ID or use an Licensed dealer.

Private sellers are encouraged to keep paper work to aid in law enforcement investigation but its not required or mandated

Thats just the federal law for private sellers.

After all, do you think Republican politicians are able to do anything if they see their voter base being silenced and shamed into submission by the left, and they worry about their reelection chances? Similarly, do you think Republican politicians dare to try to back stab their voters if their voters are anywhere as fervent as the left's voters are when it comes to campaigning and fighting for issues important to them? These people are inherently cowards, and will simply follow the path of least resistance.

"&gt;barring any kind of weird skeletons

&amp;#x200B;

Trump had no skeletons and still you find reasons to reject him. And mind you, DeSantis hasnt yet gone through the gauntlet of investigations and audits that Trump did, so we still dont know if he's as clean as Trump was. I know Trump isnt exactly squeaky clean, but he's very likely cleaner than the overwhelming majority of elected representatives in the entire nation. Something tells me DeSantis is gonna go down the same road. He's gonna get investigated, he's gonna be found to have done something weird or odd, the MSM is gonna blow it up and the backstabbing war mongering RINOs are gonna bitch about it calling it too radical or too Trump like, and you're probably gonna jump on that bandwagon and reject him too. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  I knew people who hold conservative values who voted for Biden just because they were butthurt about his rhetoric. 

&amp;#x200B;

And this is exactly why DeSantis wont survive if the swamp, big tech and corporate MSM isnt taken to the cleaners. These people have been smearing and tarring good people for years, and if you think DeSantis will magically be immune to them, you're dead wrong. Main reason why conservatives reject Trump isnt directly because of his rhetoric, but rather because his rhetoric causes the insane MSM and liberal citizenry to go insane and that's what they're butthurt about. If the MSM and big tech treated Trump like they did Obama, I'd bet my entire life savings that we will not see even half of the backlash we did amongst the conservatives. And hey, I personally know quite a few conservatives who think Obama was a great US president. They dont want to be called racists, and they think that since the media didint make such a big fuss about him, he's probably done a good job. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  I say we need new blood that still shows conviction 

&amp;#x200B;

I would say that Trump's considered new blood. He's not a career politician. Still got rejected. Going by your post, I'm guessing that you want someone who's got the skills of a career politician but who does not work as a career politician. Lets take a look at DeSantis's history. He graduated in 2005. He entered military service in 2004 (still in school) and exited in 2010, entering the reserves. In 2012 he ran and won Florida's 6th congressional district. In 2019 he won the race for Florida Governor. In other words, as much as I hate to say it, I think he fits the bill of ""career politician"" more than Trump does, who's got what, 50 odd years under his belt as a businessman with no time spent in the military (shame he dodged the draft tho) or in public office. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its kinda funny, but IMO its the voters who lack conviction, not the politicians. You got Trump who's got plenty of conviction, but the voters lacked it to support him all the way, instead choosing to let themselves be manipulated by the MSM and big tech and falling on themselves in internal struggles. Remember the Covington kids? I remember. The majority of conservatives I know in the first hour of the news breaking rushed to condemn the high schooler wearing that MAGA cap. They voted Trump in, but lacked the conviction to at least put in some additional time to try to give him and his agenda the benefit of the doubt before piling on to say something. Something tells me this will repeat itself during DeSantis's admin.

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, Trump fits your stated/listed preferences for president more than DeSantis would, and you still clearly favor DeSantis over Trump. Based off your reasoning for that, I'd say that you (just like most of the conservatives out there) are taken in by the MSM rhetoric and big tech censorship and conditioned to believe that oRaNgEmAnBaD. You dont care if Trump's legislations and works as POTUS is good or not (by most aspects he's done a better job than Bush and Obama, and in the war aspect he's done better than both Bushes, Obama and Clinton). You only care if his image is good or not. And that, is how you get Obama again in 2020 where Joe Biden won, but Obama's giving him advice and Obama's people are running the show while Biden's taking his dementia fueled naps.",1617932440.0,gtvs2pi,t1_gtux95z,/r/Republican/comments/mmyz32/ron_desantis_is_what_the_posttrump_gop_should/gtvs2pi/,1.0,1617946840.0,"kind, skeletons, t1_gtux95z, reasons, gauntlet, investigations, audits, Trump, majority, representatives, nation, road, war, RINOs, bandwagon, people, values, rhetoric, swamp, tech, cleaners, years, reason, conservatives, citizenry, life, savings, half, backlash, president, racists, media, didint, fuss, job, blood, conviction, career, politician, post, skills, Lets, look, history, service, school, reserves, district, race, words, bill, belt, businessman, time, military, shame, draft, tho, office, voters, politicians, plenty, way, struggles, kids, hour, news, breaking, schooler, cap, agenda, benefit, doubt, admin, preferences, reasoning, censorship, oRaNgEmAnBaD., legislations, aspects, aspect, image, advice, show, dementia, naps",0.4814019505398816,0.08020985719261582,0.0

"To your first point, it clearly states ""imminent danger of death and bodily function unless surgery is performed"". Imminent means ""ready to happen and happening soon"" not you got 2 more years to like you forgo cancer therapy. Guess by your definition, a baby born yesterday is facing imminent death in about 70 years.

Hey by the way taking a pill ain't surgery.

Your second point literally proves my own point. It is now a felony for doctors to prescribe hormones that stop luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) secretion.

LH and FSH are hormones that include testosterone, estrogen and progesterone. They are produced by the pituitary gland and are regulated by the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) receptor. If you don't want LH or FSH production you would block the GnRH receptor, and the pituitary gland will therefore never get the signal to start producing LH and FSH.

Here's a list of what blocking the GnRH receptor can help treat (notice all the different types of cancers)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing\_hormone\_antagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone_antagonist)

Here's another from National Institute of Health in the use of GnRH receptor blocking in cancer treatment

No, but I know other people inlcuding myself who have gone through this themselves.

&gt;This is the first time I have ever heard of Therapists trying to ferret out the reason for Gender Trendisitioners.

That is their job, to determine whether someone has gender dysphoria or not.

&gt;The fact, and the law, is that your parents know what you need better than you do. The vast majority of children who experience gender issues, that includes you, end up dropping their obsession with gender. If you are one of the few people who persist with their Gender obsession through adulthood. 

I'm am a legal adult now and I feel the same way at 20 as I did then, nothing has changed. And I have never met someone who was serious about this because they knew who they were and has now felt differently as an adult either. 

&gt;Your parents know, better than you, if your beliefs about gender are internally driven or trend driven.

My parents wouldn't accept it then, now, or later on. They aren't looking out for me, they don't like trans people. 

Instead of just believing it's a trend because you think so, if you are really curious listen to the experiences of people who suffer from gender dysphoria. And honestly even if hypothetically people were doing it as some trend hypothetically, it's still not the place for the government to get involved. 

Before I became a Libertarian, I actually was a Republican. I believe in small government that doesn't interfere with our lives.  I always believed in the Republican small government until I saw stuff like this happening where they want big government to interfere with LGBTQ people, fuel the war on drugs, and some of them even supporting gun grabbing laws just like Democrats do. I still do vote Republican if it's a candidate I believe in or if it's a swing race, but I strongly feel we need the party of small government, cause we already have the party of obedience to the state in power right now.",1617803755.0,gtosjg1,t1_gtoqozz,/r/Republican/comments/mlnwei/arkansas_legislature_overrides_republican_gov_asa/gtosjg1/,1.0,1617818155.0,"t1_gtoqozz, baby, sex, traffickers, faith, arguments, people, time, Therapists, reason, job, gender, dysphoria, fact, law, parents, majority, children, issues, obsession, adulthood, adult, way, gt;Your, beliefs, trend, trans, listen, experiences, place, government, lives, stuff, war, drugs, gun, laws, candidate, swing, race, party, obedience, state, power",0.4091269841269842,0.054613095238095245,0.0

&gt; “Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small. In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is in some small way to become evil oneself. One's standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control.

"Your statement confuses me because you said ""take a bunch of gender questioning kids and put them on blockers, and most of them will go on hormones"", but have you not considered that the sample is already heavily weighted for that? Cis kids who know they are cis won't just go on blockers for no reason, and forcing them on blockers isn't ethical. Therefore, your sample will mostly be of kids who are questioning their gender. Now that sounds like it should be a 50-50 chance, but it isn't. If you question your gender, there's often a good reason why as most cis people don't. It's sort of how most straight people don't spend a lot of time questioning if they're straight. A kid going on blockers is often a big decision so the majority of the time, the kid has already come to the conclusion that they are trans and are wanting to go on blockers until they can start hormones (getting on HRT takes longer to get approved by a doctor than blockers, though both take awhile). Therefore most of these kids going on blockers are going to go on HRT, not because the ""blockers confused them"" or something,but because the blockers are the step before HRT. To me it sounds like you are arguing something akin to "" men experimenting with other males causes them to be gay"" when in reality, they were probably gay already.

&gt;“Puberty-blocking drugs” means gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues or other synthetic drugs used in biological males to stop luteinizing hormone secretion and therefore testosterone secretion, or synthetic drugs used in biological females which stop the production of estrogens and progesterone 

It is now a felony for doctors to prescribe hormones that stop luteinizing hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) secretion.

Now to the fun science part.

LH and FSH are hormones that include testosterone, estrogen and progesterone. They are produced by the pituitary gland and are regulated by the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) receptor. If you don't want LH or FSH production you would block the GnRH receptor, and the pituitary gland will therefore never get the signal to start producing LH and FSH.

Here's a list of what blocking the GnRH receptor can help treat (notice all the different types of cancers)

"For starters police doesn’t actually need to have to see a perceived threat. Whether you believe the ‘liberal media’ or not I have seen more news coverage of guns drawn on non-violent complicit or slightly aggravated (though the reason they were slightly aggravated was generally due to the fact they feel discriminated against) black Americans. Legally, yes, they have to see a perceived threat to pull a firearm, but the police departments are more likely to believe the officers they hired over the general public. Though this is not only seen in America, it is still a problem that police are perceived as more truthful within the justice department than the general public. A police officer could say that they have felt or seen a threading scene going on and drawn their guns but have a completely racially motivated reasoning (whether they realise it or not). I don’t get the numbers you are trying to push here. I have read it many times and it just doesn’t make sense to me, nor anything said after that makes sense either ( though it might be sleep deprivation playing a role in me not understanding). Bringing up you earlier point, you brought up that having a father figure, or rather a lack there of, increases the likelihood to commit crime. Most of these children without father figures in there lives grow up in low income neighbourhoods where the system has given up on them. Gangs and drugs run the streets and the government only cares to incarcerate when they do bad rather than prevent the generation from doing bad. There are actually a higher number of white Americans that live in single parent households but most white Americans have it better off in better neighbourhoods even in these impoverished neighbourhoods because the government didn’t give up on them, and the only discernable difference I can see is the racial diversity of these states or the neighbourhoods. Though these neighbourhoods were created for affordable housing for Americans they were basically ruled by black Americans that were pushed into these tunnels due to racism from the abolishment of slavery and further on by white Americans  that keep these communities from developing with the rest of white america. You don’t need statistics to see if you are born into a white family over a black family you are perceived differently, you are given more opportunities in life, your happiness with your own race and your accumulative wealth over your life or from family born wealth.  I will not write again as there is no point arguing back and forth between people who will never change their minds. Though I will always say never to give up on what you believe in I must leave this debate because the stubbornness with republicans or us democrats now a days whether it is someone who cannot see their own white privilege, a trump supporter who cannot see the flaws in their idol or a democrat that cannot see anything right or good within the Republican Party.

Evidence from initial studies was inadequate, but more recent reports from larger trials meant we could conclude in our review that hydroxychloroquine is not beneficial for patients with COVID-19 who require care in hospital. The evidence is less clear for prevention of COVID-19 and for people being treated as outpatients. However, with no benefit when used for treatment of severe COVID-19, a benefit in these situations is unlikely.”

I live in a town where there are not many homeless people BUT they get quite a few homeless people voting every year. In order to be eligible you have to provide an address but if you say you’re homeless they set it to a standardized address. You need no identification to register and nothing to prove who you are. I’m sure homeless voters are a very small share of voter fraud situations but the point remains the same.,1617718338.0,gtkkvhe,t3_mlaer3,/r/Republican/comments/mlaer3/if_democrats_will_cry_racist_no_matter_what/gtkkvhe/,1.0,1617732738.0,"town, people, year, order, address, identification, voters, share, voter, fraud, situations, point",0.4389814814814815,-0.023106060606060613,0.0

"So for starters the fatherless rate is brought up not out of stereotyping but out of evidence. Nearly 60% of African American children under the age of 18 grow up without one of their parents in the home. Of this about 75% (just under 50% of total African American families) have single mothers. That’s not stereotyping that’s the disheartening truth. Not having a father in the household is the largest factor in determining whether a child will turn to crime (though you are absolutely right there are other factors at work). 

I bring this up because police interactions cannot be taken with a wholistic view of America’s demographics. This is because in order for the police to draw their weapon, there has to be a perceived threat. But taking it back a step they have to have had an encounter with someone of any race before there can be a threat. The situations where police pull their weapons out are violent crimes. A black man is much more likely than a white man to commit a violent crime with something like 30% (give or take a little) of all violent crimes committed by black men. White men commit about 35% or so. If you then take these numbers and adjust based on population you see that the likelihood of a white male committing a violent crime (roughly 30% of America’s population committing 35% of violent crimes) is much lower than a black male (roughly 6% of the population committing just under 30% of all violent crimes). Again, I’m not saying this isn’t an issue, it absolutely is, my point in saying it is that it isn’t actually due to racism or race based privilege the specific situation of the police is due to increased interactions with the police as a result of more crimes being committed.

Why needs fixing is us. We need to accept that for all forms of media there will naturally be a left slant. Conservatives need to conserve what is or was while progressives need to change what is or was. Therefore most creatives are going to drill down on what is not working and illustrate that through story. The opposite of that is nostalgia which is also very popular in entertainment but the louder voice is often “show me something new.” So the change must be in ourselves that left leaning isn’t an attack on conservatism it’s just more interesting because it hasn’t been seen so it’s new ideas to explore.,1617716235.0,gtkgif4,t1_gtkexid,/r/Republican/comments/mkyr5h/have_you_guys_noticed_how_much_more_democrat/gtkgif4/,1.0,1617730635.0,"forms, media, slant, Conservatives, progressives, creatives, story, opposite, nostalgia, entertainment, voice, change, attack, conservatism, ideas",0.3697979797979798,0.2397171717171717,0.0

On the elite level - yes. There shouldn’t be such an obvious disadvantage towards women. That must change. Sports on an amateur level is completely different.

"I don’t have it for that, but I can give you a real life example. 

Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle brought regulation to meat packing. Who wanted it and supported it the most? Armour Foods. He realized he would knock out a lot of the small competitors by adding regulations to meat packing. 

&gt; Though his novelized and sensational accusations prompted later congressional investigations of the industry, the investigators themselves expressed skepticism of Sinclair's integrity and credibility as a source of information. President Theodore Roosevelt wrote of Sinclair in a letter to William Allen White in July 1906, ""I have an utter contempt for him. He is hysterical, unbalanced, and untruthful. Three-fourths of the things he said were absolute falsehoods. For some of the remainder there was only a basis of truth.""2

&gt; Some two million visitors came to tour the stockyards and packinghouses of Chicago every year. Thousands of people worked in both. Why is it that it took a novel written by an anti-capitalist ideologue who spent but a few weeks there to unveil the real conditions to the American public?

&gt;All of the big Chicago packers combined accounted for less than 50 percent of the meat products produced in the United States; few if any charges were ever made against the sanitary conditions of the packinghouses of other cities. If the Chicago packers were guilty of anything like the terribly unsanitary conditions suggested by Sinclair, wouldn't they be foolishly exposing themselves to devastating losses of market share?

&gt;**Historians with an ideological axe to grind against the market usually ignore an authoritative 1906 report of the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Husbandry. Its investigators provided a point-by-point refutation of the worst of Sinclair's allegations, some of which they labeled as ""willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact,"" ""atrocious exaggeration,"" and ""not at all characteristic.""**7

&gt;Instead, some of these same historians dwell on the Neill-Reynolds Report of the same year because it at least tentatively supported Sinclair. It turns out that neither Neill nor Reynolds had any experience in the meat packing business and spent a grand total of two and one-half weeks in the spring of 1906 investigating and preparing what turned out to be a carelessly written report with preconceived conclusions. **Gabriel Kolko, a socialist but nonetheless an historian with a respect for facts, dismisses Sinclair as a propagandist and assails Neill and Reynolds as ""two inexperienced Washington bureaucrats who freely admitted they knew nothing""8 of the meat packing process. Their own subsequent testimony revealed that they had gone to Chicago with the intention of finding fault with industry practices** so as to get a new inspection law passed.9

&gt; In the end, Americans got a new federal meat inspection law. **The big packers got the taxpayers to pick up the entire $3 million price tag for its implementation as well as new regulations on their smaller competitors**, and another myth entered the annals of anti-market dogma.

**To his credit, Upton Sinclair actually opposed the law because he saw it for what it really was — a boon for the big meat packers.10** Far from a crusading and objective truth-seeker, Sinclair was a fool and a sucker who ended up being used by the very industry he hated.

"I think you misunderstood my point. The point I'm trying to make is that most boomer Republicans who  always vote R get their media from Fox but the new generation of conservatives get their news from many different sources alternate and mainstream. By alternative, I mean content creators such as Crowder, Shapiro, Tim Pool, Joe Rogan etc. (Im not saying I do. But many do) 

Calling out the media when they objectively lie about you and your supporters when they demonize straight white men, when they cause mainstream liberals to race bait whenever there is a mass shooting into believing the culprit is a white Christian Trump supporter when it usually is the opposite, is important. 

Constantly demonizing people using smear campaigns and unsubstantiated attacks, mainly the -isms to ignore talking and debating about policy issues which most Conservatives would welcome. When it seems the overarching sentiment in the nation is ""Orange man bad"" and you have to dig deep to find his redeeming qualities because all mainstream people ever talk about are his flaws is one way you will get the politically uninformed/nonparticipants to automatically vote Dem because they are fed with propaganda left, right and center. 

This can be attributed to the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 where it became legal for the government to disseminate propaganda to the American people. 

And the last point about conservatives and a civil war I think is just rubbish. No one is talking of a hot civil war but maybe one that is already occurring for the last few years where it is an information civil war, a struggle for the hearts and minds of the upcoming generation of people. I strongly doubt that it would ever escalate to combat in the streets, even though in some instances last summer it had. 

All in all I think this is just about both sides getting info from sources that would reinforce their beliefs but whereas one side largely gets their info from corporate media which broadcasts basically the same thing, the other side likes to diversify their sources and listen to unfiltered, real people give their commentary on current events. Most mainstream conservatives welcome debate, and from what I've seen most liberals will eventually devolve into using smears and ad hominem attacks against their opposition instead of consistent logic based opinions.",1617682081.0,gtj9c72,t1_gtirqgs,/r/Republican/comments/mkm34c/republicans_trust_in_the_media_is_at_an_all_time/gtj9c72/,1.0,1617696481.0,"point, boomer, t1_gtirqgs, R, media, generation, conservatives, news, sources, alternative, content, creators, supporters, men, mainstream, liberals, race, bait, shooting, culprit, supporter, people, smear, campaigns, attacks, -isms, policy, issues, overarching, sentiment, nation, man, qualities, flaws, way, nonparticipants, propaganda, left, center, government, war, one, years, information, struggle, hearts, minds, streets, instances, summer, sides, info, beliefs, side, thing, commentary, events, debate, smears, ad, hominem, opposition, logic, opinions",0.3387871879893156,0.1265715667311412,0.0

"So I’m going to address those points in order: 

First, the case for a school determining who gets in based off of ethnicity is in direct violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title 6. It says that it is illegal to discriminate based on race which is what these schools are engaging in by 1 using that as a tiebreaker (which lets be real doesn’t happen often) but more importantly occurs when less qualified students get admitted due to being a less represented race on campus.

Secondly, the job quality argument isn’t really about racism. In fact, I don’t believe is racism has anything to do with it. Instead I believe it has to do with the United States becoming a welfare state that incentivizes no male parent in the home. Without a father figure in the home a child is something like (and I’m trying to remember this so apologies if my numbers are off) 10 times more likely to get arrested for a violent crime. The issue with these neighborhoods is the absence of fathers for children, again, created through this welfare state. 

Thirdly, the previous point ties into this one. With a father figure not in the home, a child often turns to gangs or other means of “familial” bonding. This results in much more violent offenders coming from welfare communities. As a result, these people have more police interactions than most people outside of those communities. Those communities (due to our welfare system) are often heavily African American leading to increased police interaction. These (male) African Americans commit 60% of robberies and 53% of murders in our country. If you compare, 9 unarmed blacks were shot in 2019 while 19 unarmed whites were shot in 2019 you can argue that adjusted for population that isn’t equally representative but if you adjust by interactions due to violent crimes (the situation where police typically use deadly force) you actually see that black people are less likely to be shot without a weapon. Additionally, a police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be shot by a black male than a black male would be by a cop if he were unarmed. Add in the fact that a philly study from 2015 showed that white and Hispanic cops are LESS likely to shoot an unarmed black person than a black police officer was and I think it clearly shows that what were showed on TV isn’t representative of what is actually going on.

Finally, I want to address a George Floyd like situation. Many are not aware of this but something similar has happened to a white person before. If you look up Tony Timpa, you’ll see a similarly controversial restraint used against him for over 10 minutes. What’s more incredibly was that this was in 2019 about a year before George Floyd’s passing. This was something that never made it to national headlines because it wasn’t something that fit the narrative of what the media is trying to portray. It’s sad that I have to say this, but you can’t get all of your information from news stations anymore. You have to research on your own because no where gives you the full story. Every news station plays what it wants in order to cater towards its audience and it is disgustingly divisive.",1617680068.0,gtj61s6,t1_gtj0wvk,/r/Republican/comments/mko8du/white_privilege_doesnt_exist/gtj61s6/,1.0,1617694468.0,"points, order, case, school, determining, ethnicity, violation, t1_gtj0wvk, Title, race, schools, tiebreaker, students, campus, job, quality, argument, racism, fact, welfare, state, parent, home, father, figure, child, apologies, numbers, times, crime, issue, neighborhoods, absence, fathers, children, point, ties, one, gangs, means, bonding, offenders, communities, result, people, police, interactions, system, interaction, %, robberies, murders, country, blacks, whites, population, crimes, situation, force, weapon, officer, male, cop, study, cops, person, TV, restraint, minutes, year, headlines, narrative, media, information, news, stations, story, station, audience",0.43457711442786073,0.030286069651741302,0.0

They look at him like they do bill nye. Neither one is a scientists but they look at them as a Steven Hawking. Both are full of shit. Bill Nye was an engineer and actor. He read lines.

"Did you even read your own sources? 

“The using of affirmative action to promote opportunities for white women rather than for people of color”  That’s from Kendall’s long ass explanation of white privilege from 2002 which I can confidently say didn’t age well. Since his article was written numerous if not all his examples given have been crushed. The Rooney rule in the NFL for example was added in 2003. Saying white privilege doesn’t exist might be inaccurate because it did at one point. But in 2021 it’s long gone. The rest of the sources are just shit liberal opinion articles and ones a PowerPoint that just gives broad definitions and no statistical evidence on anything. Just throwing this out there too but 99% of what these articles call white privilege is just saying white people are more likely to accumulate wealth. There’s reasons for that too but you can’t say that a poor white guy gets better health care than LeBron James.  

My opinion is that the black community needs more role models to preach the importance of being a father to their children. When you look at the number of black children that grow up with no father it almost looks like a typo compared to other races.

"Firstly, it is true to a point that white applicants to colleges/universities will be more likely to be turned down than a minority but that would be to that specific college, university or a place of higher education to choose to have an ethnically diverse campus and the reason you see more white applicants turned away is due to the fact that the white enrolment into higher education is higher than both black and hispanic students. This would be primarily due to the economic deficit between Caucasian and other races where you would see higher poverty rates within black and hispanic communities. Within jobs it would be the same but white people generally see better job prospects due to the fact that a high percentage has taken themselves into higher education. It is a genuine fact that white people hold better jobs than black or Hispanic Americans, though ethnic diversity within good jobs have increased for everyone, white peoples still hold the majority. Secondly, I am truly sorry to make you think that I think all minorities are criminals. I must rephrase myself. As I live on the outside of America I have only seen the stories which shows statistics that shows that minorities have been seen as more violent or have been beaten/ killed e.g. George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in recent retrospect. I have seen right wing republicans have prejudice against migrants EG what ever tucker Carlson says, and yes I will wholeheartedly agree with you that most people aren’t racist especially modern day America. 
I have to disagree with you about having no privilege because you are statistically less likely to commit a crime. Again with the police, there have been statistically more violent and strict against African American people than white people, again I have to bring up George Floyd. There is no way that would of happened towards a white American (I will apologise to you if you can find an article of an instance of a white officer suffocating a white American and in the brutal way that George Floyd was killed). I have heard a lot of stories of African Americans  and a lot of accounts of African Americans (from YouTube) be afraid of the police because they know the prejudice that is put against them. Another thing that compiles into white privilege is how black Americans were treated after the abolishment of slavery. The economy of America definitely wasn’t shared equally from there on. Black Americans didn’t usually have high paying jobs so they couldn’t build up wealth as white Americans did. Though I do believe that white privilege isn’t as significant as before it is still an ongoing issue in western societies. Though you don’t believe in white privilege you have to see and take into account that you will feel safer around police than a black American (sorry for assuming race, apologies if you are African American). I respect your opinion but I just can’t agree with it. Personally, the evidence I have seen shows me that it is real. Though you don’t believe it exists now you have to say that it has and does exist to a degree. Remember that if you don’t/can’t see it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.

"The thing about that is that Main stream is basically political speak for perceived left leaning media. Both parties do it. That's how for example fox news stays out of this nebulous main stream despite being bigger than the other networks.

And yes the guy above you is correct in the fact that Hitler did indeed discredit any media opposing him as the 'lying press' or in German 'Lügenpresse'.

As to your argument about conservatives consulting multiple sources. Face it that's not true. A vast majority of people on both sides are vastly uninformed about politics and consult no sources at all to form their opinions other than finding out what their party thinks. That is just a simple fact. We have just reached a point in society where two generally uninformed groups can fling shit at each other and claim they are backed by the 'correct' information. One side will call it mainstream the other alternative.

What Hitler succeeded in doing regarding information distribution is largely the same as the system of information that we have today. Two groups can create two completely separate narratives and try to debate each other armed with two different sets of facts. Thus facilitating tribalism after all your political enemy is too dumb to see the 'real' truth snd will only consult information that confirms their biases. This isn't a direct call out to you by the way. This is exactly how liberals too think of conservatives, since they personally know conservatives in their lives who do that, just as you will inevitably know liberals who do that.

The end result is, if society doesnt get its shit together there will be an even greater division and a civil war might truly be the end result.

"The issue isn't that ""whoa is me, voter ID laws are RACIST"" thats just a simplification of the issue because it makes people who dont take the time to understand the issue go ""wow everything is racist with these people, I'm very smart because there's never been systemic racism in America""

The issue is, if you take 5 minutes to look into it, Repubs wrote the damn book on Voter Suppression and giving them yet another way to do so is not worth preventing a few dozen instances of ""voter fraud"" that happen every year from both sides. Especially since less than 5 months ago the leader of the party was totally down for overthrowing democracy because he lost.

Did you forget about that already? Because we haven't. The leader of the Republican's party. Tried. To overthrow. Democracy. By spurring on a riot that bought into this weird idea that the guy who lost the popular vote in 2016... against one of the worst possible candidate on the Dem side mind you... after 4 years of derisive statements, somehow couldn't have lost unless there was some kind of massive conspiracy.

States ALREADY have legal means to register to vote. You have to register already. Republican leaders are just using word play to make it seem like Dems just want votes to go flying all over the place because they lost in Georgia and, if it weren't for their gerrymandering and cheating, they would have already lost Texas.

Depends on the state, and whether they follow the laws.

For example, in the Wisconsin 2020 elections, Absentee ballots have to be witnessed by someone who is at least 18 and a US citizen, the name and address of that witness have to be on the ballot, and the witness has to sign the outside of the ballot envelope.  If a ballot is sent in without that witness information, the law says it must be discarded.  Seems pretty secure - except the people counting the votes in Wisconsin didn't follow the law.

"So you didn't even read the paper you're basing your argument on? Or did you not understand it? Home ownership is declining because 80% of the US lives in metropolitan areas and the population has doubled in the last 50 years. There's only so much land, so supply cannot keep up with demand, especially in Democrat controlled cities with insane regulations. Do you have a source that dual income houses are barely getting by? Birth rates have been declining in developed nations for decades. 

The people who create that food via farming also like to be paid for their work. If you want to end farm subsidies I can understand, the problem is other nations subsidize their farms so if the US doesn't do likewise then US farmers won't be able to compete in the market. It's basic geopolitical strategy to have a secure supply of food. 

""Without government subsidies workers wouldn’t have a reason to work at Walmart (or anywhere else for that matter)""

"I’d definitely be interested in something imperical beyond what u/raxxius provided.

That being said, at the end of the day, social media is a terribly game-able system and not the best measure for popular support. At its best, social media participation and endorsement of individuals is a practice by a self selected group. That is to say, people who find a person appealing or revolting can elect to flock at will. It can be a proximal measure, but the amount of gaming that can be done taints it a lot. Motivated individuals and groups can create automated processes that create users at will to upvote or downvote / like or unlike — influence the popularity of anything. 

We should recognize that and understand that, at best, social media platforms will always fail to be an accurate measure of either popularity or efficacy of a politician. In fact, quite the opposite: I think the trend is to skew either way. 

Random scientific polling will continue to be how we measure things. And Social media will continue to get in the way of manipulating opinion. 

I’m not saying Biden is more popular than Trump or vice versa; I’m just saying that using internet likes is not a good measure of popularity or success or competency, etc.  There are tons of morons with ridiculous content that get 10s of millions of views *daily*.

"My first response was to specifically ruled out incidents where 100+ people could very sensibly live at a given street address.  That a fraudulent voter is registered as Republican is irrelevant because all ballots are supposed to be secret.

About addresses being vacant lots and such being okay, I guess you missed the fact that many of the convictions I cited involved that sort of thing.  You also missed how many addresses were not even valid.  Like around the 33 minute mark where the voter address is 221 N Spruce Street.  The problem is that there's 219, then 223, but no 221.  Around 37:44 is an address that corresponds to a sound wall.  At about 41:30 is 2175 W Agate.  There is no address lower than 2700.  It goes on and on.  How do you account for those?

"I'll say what I told the lead detective during my sworn statement. When someone is in cuffs and not posing a threat, any force above the force needed to restrain I feel is unacceptable. In my case it was kidney strikes from the officer that had his legs. In this case the kneeling on the neck would be more force than reasonably needed. 

If you believe pressure must be on the arteries to kill you're sadly mistaken. You can die in the manner George did by being placed in a constricting position that hinders you're breathing. It's the same way a child can die from falling between the bed and the wall. Being placed on your stomach can hinder breathing, being handcuffed on your stomach furthers that, being handcuffed on your back with the weight of a grown man plus kit on your neck will greatly add to the risk. 

When you're being restrained in such a manner it's usually until you gain compliance. The fact he was handcuffed and face down says to me that they could have transitioned to a different positioning.

"Okay that doesn't really disprove my point that there are idiots on both sides, also while the election wasn't stolen and there is no evidence of wide spread voter fraud, the mail in ballots system was really faulty due to a lack of verification which lead to more votes coming in compared to the amount who registered 133 million registered but 159 million were cast.

"I've dealt with something like this first hand. Was working one night and this guy kept making 911 calls. He was super paranoid, come to find out he had just gotten out of a mental health hospital. We decided to take him to the hospital, put him in cuffs, he was willing but confused. He started fighting us and legit had a full blown episode. Crying and begging for his life, legit was in fear and thought we were killing him. After about 5-8 mins he went limp on us.

Come to find out he had coke, alcohol and whatever prescriptions they gave him for his issues in his system. You can make the argument that if we took a different approach he'd still be here. You can argue that he'd have died without us being involved. However the only thing in my mind that can be proven is that we sped up what happened.

I've seen people way way above the ""lethal dose""  and walk around like nothing. Ive seen people take no where close to that amount and need narcan. The human body is an amazing thing. And no one can say anything regarding this outcome except the actions that were taken hastened his demise. Also it should be noted that he was handcuffed. Controlling his legs and arms should be enough to stop him from being a threat. In our case we didn't kneel on the neck.

"Actually Communism and Socialism have occurred in isolated instances around the globe and in most of them it's been to the benefit of the people of that nation. Take the story of Thomas Sankara, an ex-General who helped lead the peoples revolution of Burkina Faso, or Evo Morales, the ex-Incumbent Presidente of Bolivia (Before an American backed coup at the hands of Jeanine Anez). Or even more recently, the current Incumbent Presidente of Bolivia, Luis Arce, who is currently the leading head of the MAS (Movement For Socialism) party.

Thomas Sankara aided the people as President of Burkina Faso in pretty substantial ways, he increased the populations overall literacy, managed to substantially decrease overall poverty in the small African country, and not only that, but he almost managed to establish a trade pact with some of the more fortunate first world nations of Europe, however, he was assassinated by the French. 

Bolivia is experiencing most of the same fortunes as Communist Burkina Faso, and is currently living off of the South American Trading bloc (MERCOSUR) which allows them to thrive despite US embargos.

How does Walmart skirt taxes? They paid $4.28 billion in federal income tax in 2019. That's also not including property taxes or payroll taxes. Walmart has no control over government funded social welfare programs. It's not their fault if their employees are financially irresponsible and work low wage jobs with multiple children. I'm guessing that you don't live in a rural area because if you did you'd be aware that Walmart usually pays significantly more than their local competitors especially when you consider the benefits offered.

This happens all to often in politically unstable countries, where a peoples revolution will occur, and then the state will take up the ""mantle of Communism"" while never actually committing to the promises Communism ensured by it's definition.

Apr 2, 2021 - A conservative non-profit advocacy group monitoring Big Tech claims almost all Facebook and Twitter employee and committee campaign contributions went to Democrats on House oversight committees.

https://theiap.org/media/press/iap-analysis-facebook-twitter-donations-12-1-favor-dems-over-gop/

The Internet Accountability Project (IAP) said in an April 1 statement that, based on campaign finance data compiled by opensecrets.org, Facebook and Twitter (employees and PACs) combined “contributed more than 12 times more money to Democrats (more than $5.5 million) than Republicans (less than $435,000) in 2020.” The group cited a leading self-proclaimed socialist in the House of Representatives as an example of the extreme bias in favor of Democrats in political giving by employees of the two Internet giants. “As just one example, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez received a combined $36,346 in 2020 compared to less than $1,950 for all Republicans on the House Oversight Committee combined. Twitter employees did not give a single dollar to Republicans on the Oversight Committee,” IAP said in its statement...",1617425146.0,gt7t4ze,t3_mj1kbs,/r/Republican/comments/mj1kbs/facebook_twitter_campaign_donations/gt7t4ze/,1.0,1617439546.0,"SS, t3_mj1kbs, advocacy, group, claims, employee, committee, campaign, contributions, oversight, committees, Internet, statement, finance, data, employees, times, money, self, socialist, example, bias, favor, giving, giants, dollar",0.3386243386243387,0.10780423280423279,0.0

Georgia House Republicans on Wednesday night retaliated against Delta’s CEO and passed a bill to repeal a tax break on jet fuel. House Speaker David Ralston (R) on Thursday morning said the vote to repeal the tax break was in response to Bastian’s memo. “They like our public policy when we’re doing things that benefit them, and they reap the rewards of those benefits and then turn around and do this,” Ralston said, according to Georgia Public Broadcasting. “As all of you know, I can’t resist a country boy line or two, you don’t feed a dog that bites your hand.

"Some effects take very long to appear. One line in an article does not disprove that one bit. 

These are truly horrible diseases. Perhaps for someone at high risk of covid the risk is worth it. But for a young girl, definitely not. Thin women under the age of 50 have almost a cero percent chance of dying from covid, and they have to catch the disease first. As someone in that group, there’s no logical reason to risk potential side effects, even short term ones that have already appeared (vomiting, passing out, nonstop shaking). Not to mention long term effects, some of which could appear in forty years. It maybe never make sense to get it for some people. 

The ‘experts’ have flip flopped nonstop. From vaccines don’t stop the spread to they do 100%, but remain masked. So then, what? Clearly, we’re missing well done, peer reviewed trials by scientists with no political connections. So to pretend that it’s ‘selfish’ not to partake in this late stage clinical trail is just a pat on theback for those who’ve chosen, of their own volition, that they wanted to take the vaccine. 

And then there’s the fact that these vaccines have novel technology, never before used in humans, so I’d hold off the certainty that dreadful side effects will not appear. I know the sunken cost fallacy applies in your case, but have some perspective. Btw, I really hope to be wrong, and that these vaccines are super safe. Many loved ones have taken them. Personally, it would be epitome of lack of risk assessment for a young woman that wants to have children, such as myself, to take this.

4) Trump didn't create a pandemic and just you saying this demonstrates how unserious you are. My state was destroyed by our governor and health commissioner. The only thing I could blame Trump for was not breaching his constitutional provision to allow states to operate independently, which may have actually been worse.

5) I'm worried about how our economy can function given the way Democrats are strangling it with these ridiculous orders and unwillingness to own up to the egregious behavior of 2020.

"I seem to recall reports back in January of 2020 or December of 2019 that scientists at the Wuhan lab had disappeared, and journalists were being rounded up. There's also the slightly inconvenient fact that there's genetic evidence that the virus arose in pangolins and jumped to bats before jumping to humans, and that lab was studying those bats.

"I think we generally agree and I totally get your point about it being a slippery slope. I'm a vaccinated Republican (Pfizer). No one should be forced to do something they don't want to do. But I view it as selfish if you expose other people by being a virus sink for mutation and infecting other people in a public setting. I'm a big believer in personal responsibility rather than government mandated responsibility.  But people also suck and lick ice cream in stores and do other malicious things. 

Realistically, half a billion people have gotten Pfizer/Moderna by now, including myself and have seen the hospitalization/death rate amongst that population fall to zero. That is incredible and more data than we've seen for a vaccine trial in recent times. Most clinical studies take longer because it's not on the infection scale of what we're seeing globally with this virus. That is why I'm happy with my decision and why I feel relieved that I won't die of covid (no matter how remote the chance is for my age group/demographic).

"I fully expect to be downvoted to hell for daring to say this in a Republican sub, but most crime statistics are horrendously inaccurate because of how racial profiling and discrimination in the judicial system leads to black crime being inflated to appear greater than it actually is while white crime is underreported because black people are frequently framed for crimes they didn’t commit while police are less likely to investigate white people in the first place and even when white people are actually committing crimes they’re more likely to be let off the hook or have their crimes outright covered up / pinned on someone else (usually a POC) by the police / courts. This phenomena is the most obviously egregious with regards to the war on drugs; it’s well known that white people use illicit drugs about as much as anyone else but they are still underrepresented in drug-related arrests/convictions/incarcerations because the “law” doesn’t care as much about holding them accountable (not that anyone should actually be imprisoned for drug-related crimes at all, but the discrepancy in how this law, like all other laws, is selectively enforced to serve the function of keeping minorities enslaved through forced prison-labor is certainly worth noting when discussing the legitimacy of statistics coming from the police, and the entire “justice” system as a whole.)

I’m saying all of this as a white person who’s been assaulted by both black and white people, I used to take crime statistics at face value until I started actually listening to other people’s lived experiences.

"It’s the entire point of our federalized system. Decentralization empowers the individual voter more. To conservatives you me everyone is the biggest minority.

communities. We can’t empower society as a whole we can’t aim to uplift a group without aiming to uplift the individuals within it. Remember the yellow vest protests in France?

"As someone who lives in Houston and have traveled to Dallas since lifting the mandate, this article is very misleading.

&gt;Every US Citizen is granted human, social, and civil rights. The justification for earning these rights is to legally go through the immigration process, apply for citizenship, get reviewed, and then granted citizenship, or not. That is the justification for the self-determination of the context of an individual wanting to live within our sovereign borders.

I am talking of morality, not laws. Laws can be good, bad, neutral. 

It was once legal to own humans as slaves in the United States. Did that make it good? It is legal for prisons to operate as slavery brokers in the US. Does that make it good to coerce humans into labor? Marijuana is not legal according to the federal government. Does that make Marijuana use bad? If the laws were to change such that immigration process was made easier, does that mean easy immigration practices are good?

You don't have to answer all these questions. What I am pointing out is that Laws do not necessarily entail morality. Laws are unreliable in that some are good and some might be bad to our own individual moral standards. Multiplication has logical methods for coming to reliable outcomes (product). When the variables are altered and as long as one applies the logical process correctly, a logical conclusion will always be reached (adding x for a y number of times will always result in a true product). If you start altering the variable of law in the context of different arguments, you may arrive at conclusions you don't agree with. Example: it is illegal to smoke weed and therefore it is bad to smoke weed (I don't smoke but I don't see why it is bad). Just because there are legal processes for immigration does not mean they ought be that way nor does it mean the processes are good.

"yeah saying  ""it's almost exclusively black men"" is obviously not true. Its almost exclusively Asian people (interracial violent crime is the overwhelming majority of violent crime for any race group). But to his point the percentage of  violent crime black people committed against Asian people is more then twice the amount  white people committed towards Asians (percentage wise of course).

"This is what's so frustrating about the border crisis differing from Trump's administration-- They have no plan and aren't taking it seriously. They don't give a damn about the human cost.

Biden clearly doesn't give a shit, he pawned it off on Harris.

Harris clearly doesn't give a shit, she's laughing about it on national television while kids are drowning in the Rio Grande every day.

Trump actually *did* something. He got criticized by the left for not doing enough, but the bottom line is kids weren't drowning in the Rio Grande under Trump. He passed Remain in Mexico, and poof, the border crisis was gone.

Mar 29, 2021 - Nearly half of Americans changed their sports viewing habits as progressive political messaging took over sporting events, according to a new poll.

The YouGov/Yahoo News poll released Monday showed that about three times as many Americans who started watching more sports in the midst of social justice messages actually watched less, Yahoo Sports reported. About 11 percent of poll respondents said they watch more sports on TV because leagues and athletes are embracing political advocacy. However, more than one-third (34.5 percent) said they were watching less.

"SS: 

Mar 31, 2021 - State lawmakers in New York appear close to agreeing on a multibillion-dollar fund to provide unemployment benefits to undocumented immigrants and former prison inmates who have been excluded from federal aid packages since the start of the pandemic. Talks between legislators and Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office have progressed to the point that they are now focused on how the relief plan, called the Excluded Workers Fund, would work “programmatically,” said state Sen. Jessica Ramos (D-Queens), one of the most vocal champions of the proposal. “Right now discussions are around eligibility and access.” It would be the country’s most-ambitious such program by a wide margin. California officials have gained national attention for a couple of relief programs for undocumented immigrants, including one last spring that provided $500 checks to a relatively small number of people who were able to connect with an overwhelmed phone system.

"Yeah, because none of these people would *ever* cheat in a big election, right?  Oops.  You must have missed the second link there.

Incidentally, when these small elections are held at the same time as the big elections, who do you expect the Democrats doing the ""small election fraud"" voted for in the big elections on their fraudulent ballots?

A few thousand votes here, a few thousand votes there... and suddenly you have real numbers.

Incidentally, the fellow in the first link was an unknown mayoral candidate who did no real advertising.  He was arrested several days before the start of early voting, while filling out over a hundred fraudulently obtained absentee ballots on his kitchen table.  He was caught because someone thought it was suspicious that someone was having absentee ballots sent to a newly-obtained P.O. box, and notified the Texas AG.

There was at least one other P.O. box involved, and we don't know how many batches of absentee ballots he sent in before he was caught.  Note that it is illegal in Texas to use a P.O. Box as an address for purposes of voting - and yet he was able to have ballots sent to at least two.

I don't figure anyone voted for him in person, knowing he'd just been caught in the act of voter fraud...

"To be acting in a racist manner, the way you treat others must be based on their racial/ethnic identity. 

It's not racist to call the police on a shoplifter--because that behavior is not based on their racial group, it's based on their criminality. 

The same is true for restricting travel from countries which have rampant anti-American terrorist groups... it's based on the risk, not the race, ethnicity, or religion. 

Finally, you're still missing the point (maybe intentionally). The left plays misleading word games to push false narratives to promote their agenda. 

They want to smear Trump and the GOP as racist white supremacists. In order to do so, they lie with fraudulent statistics and imprecise language. 

They count middle eastern Islamist terrorist attacks as ""white domestic terrorism"" and then use this ""data"" to claim white supremacist violence is growing due to Trump's rhetoric and ""racist"" policies like the ""Muslim travel ban"" as causes. 

Because if they reported the reality, which is that Islamist terrorist attacks are overrepresented relative to the percentage of Muslims in the population, then Trumps policy would be obviously viewed as a rational measure to reduce risks for Americans from terrorists infiltrating through the lax travel vetting process.

They do the same idiotic thing with the ""Stop Asian Hate"" BS-- blaming Trump and white supremacy when the attacks against Asians are coming from black people most of the time, in far left cities.

"Philosophically I'm not opposed to the idea of full legalization, but I am in a medical regard. Drugs like fentanyl take very VERY little to overdose on, and literally just touching it can give you a lethal dosage through just skin permeability. 

Some of the drugs on the market today are simply too unstable or dangerous to allow unlicensed medical practitioners to handle them in any fashion. Some of these could very easily be weaponized and should be treated with the same respect in regards to their capacity for lethality as a firearm or military grade weapon, considering some of these drugs were indeed designed with military use in mind. 

We ought to take a middle of the road approach to drugs I think. We should scientifically analyze them, and those that are mostly harmless or at least less dangerous than alcohol ought to be legalized. More dangerous drugs should have prohibitively expensive red tape, and at every red tape stop you incentivize the use of safer drugs. The most dangerous drugs, such as crocodil, should remain illegal, but in place of prison time, they should be put into rehabilitation programs, and should they repeat offend several times, then put them in prison for a substantially longer portion of time.

"Requiring ID to vote without providing easy access to obtain a free state issued ID isn’t protecting an election, it’s suppressing votes. The main problem is that most people in poor impoverished communities don’t have the means to get a state issued ID either because it isn’t free, or there isn’t a DMV, Secretary of State, etc. near enough to get an ID. Voter ID laws are perfectly fine and dandy if you first provide the infrastructure for every American to have an ID to vote with.

"Please don’t be pants-shit-phobic. It is a real problem and I wish my parents had given me pooperty blockers growing up. 


Here is the actual science! Give gender-confused kids puberty blockers and they basically all move on to hormones and become trans. Let these kids develop naturally, and the vast majority end up being normal functional humans. Of course if you're a trans activist who wants everyone else to be trans (even at heavy cost to children's physical and psychological well being) blockers are the way to go.


&gt;Back in 2012 the Tavistock was aware of two research studies which showed that 100 per cent of children on blockers progressed to cross-sex hormones, in [the Netherlands and Australia (2012).

&gt;In 2016, GIDS’s own results showed the same: evidence was emerging that “persistence was strongly correlated with the commencement of physical interventions such as the hypothalamic blocker […] and no patient desisted after having started on the hypothalamic blocker.”

&gt;By comparison, of those children who did not start on the blocker, 90.3 per cent desisted.

&gt;December 2020 - When BBC Newsnight covered the study and its preliminary findings last year it highlighted how previous research suggested all young people who took blockers went on to take cross-sex hormones - the next stage towards transitioning to the opposite gender.

&gt;The Tavistock's newly published findings appear to confirm this, with 43 out of 44 participants - or 98% - choosing to start treatment with cross-sex hormones.

&gt;All new referrals for puberty blockers are currently paused because of the High Court's ruling, and an NHS review into gender identity services for children and young people is currently under way.

&gt;On the subject of treating children, however, as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health notes in their latest Standards of Care, gender dysphoria in childhood does not inevitably continue into adulthood, and only 6 to 23 percent of boys and 12 to 27 percent of girls treated in gender clinics showed persistence of their gender dysphoria into adulthood. Further, most of the boys' gender dysphoria desisted, and in adulthood, they identified as gay rather than as transgender.

&gt;In that coverage, the Post shared claims made by some activists criticizing some scientific studies, but did not apparently fact-check those claims, so I thought I would outline the studies here.  For reference, in a previous post, I listed the results of every study that ever followed up transgender kids to see how they felt in adulthood (Do trans- kids stay trans- when they grow up?).  There are 12 such studies in all, and they all came to the very same conclusion: The majority of kids cease to feel transgender when they get older

https://www.psypost.org/2017/12/many-transgender-kids-grow-stay-trans-50499

All major studies say the exact same thing. When chemical intervention is not used, the vast majority of transgender children grow out of it.

"Well written and provocative are not things we see combined well very often but I think this article hits it. Thought provoking piece. People who make it past the headline are well rewarded.

&gt; Who will be hurt the most by those predictable effects? The people who live at the lower end of our economy today — African Americans, Hispanics, and working-class citizens of all colors, races and religions. Unfortunately, many of those people are captive members of the Democratic Party’s voting bloc and have tacitly granted approval to the very policies that will decimate their communities. 

This is trending in the opposite direction as we saw in the last election.

&gt; But despite the risks, nothing would prove more conclusively that Republicans are serious about including blacks as full partners in the American dream. Instead of supporting instant reparations being given to illegal immigrants, Republicans could spend a much smaller amount of money to provide a symbolic peace offering to the ancestors of slaves who were not lured here by hopes of a better future but were ripped out of their homeland unwittingly by vicious merchants of death and despair.

It seems like what is being proposed is a maneuver to outprogressive the progressives. There's a sort of game theory scenario at play in this thinking but I don't think it is a necessary predicament. 

The more prudent approach in my mind is to push back against conflicts theory and victim mentality and promote conservative economics and the common ground on social issues more directly to voters that haven't had it communicated to them.",1617050279.0,gsq7p6m,t3_mfycwj,/r/Republican/comments/mfycwj/how_gop_support_for_reparations_could_save_america/gsq7p6m/,1.0,1617064679.0,"things, article, Thought, provoking, piece, People, headline, gt, effects, people, end, economy, today, t3_mfycwj, working, class, citizens, colors, races, religions, members, voting, bloc, approval, policies, communities, direction, election, risks, blacks, partners, dream, reparations, immigrants, amount, money, peace, offering, ancestors, slaves, hopes, future, homeland, merchants, death, despair, maneuver, progressives, sort, game, theory, scenario, play, thinking, predicament, approach, mind, conflicts, victim, mentality, economics, ground, issues, voters",0.39327956989247315,0.04552785923753667,0.0

"The instant a gun is pulled, anyone can shoot anyone, and it’s within their rights because their lives are being threatened, regardless of what happened prior. They may get charged for what they were already doing, but if a gun is pulled on them, it wouldn’t be an additional charge to kill in self-defense. Brandishing a gun is not peaceful. It’s elevation. It’s a bet. It’s a pissing contest. Whoever has the biggest threat wins.

The liberals happened to lose this time, but they aren’t all afraid of carrying firearms. Some of them are nutcases waiting for the first opportunity to legally kill someone they don’t like.

If you pull out a gun, it should be with the intent to fire until the situation is no longer life-threatening, or else you’re increasing the threat. If the situation isn’t life-threatening, a gun may de-escalate things, but that is illegal use of force. There are public workers whose job is taking care of situations and people like this, and compensation for damage is given to victims who process things civilly. Call the cops. It isn’t a citizen’s job to protect property. It isn’t even a citizen’s job to protect their own well-being if their life isn’t being threatened.

"For the first part, the statement isn’t technically wrong, but it’s looking at only a small part of the whole picture. While the GDP growth was quite slow, other parts of the economy had much higher rates of growth such as the jobs market, which, at least according to what I read, was the best of at least the past 6 presidents even with the recession he had to recover from. Furthermore, he saved the US auto industry and improved the stock market greatly with a 235% increase within the S&amp;P 500. Not to say that there weren’t issues with his presidencies economic policies such as the aforementioned low GDP growth, but to say that it was the worst recovery in US history is a blatant exaggeration.

"That is correct, you can't give people anything within 150 ft of the polling place.  If you want to setup a booth 200 ft out and hand out stuff to people who come to your booth, you can.  If you want to bring water to the line yourself, you can.  If the poll workers want to make water available to electors in line, they can.  If an *unaffiliated citizen* wants to make water available, that citizen simply needs to coordinate with the poll workers to do so.

This is not preventing anyone from **having** water in line, it is preventing any form of gift giving or campaigning within 150 ft of the polling place.

What would you say if someone wearing MAGA gear was handing out water to people in line and those water bottle labels said ""Provided to you by Donald Trump""?  Would you accept that water being handed out in line or consider it campaigning?  What if the person handing out the water wasn't wearing a MAGA hat and the label was the water brand, but when handing out the water the person told the electors ""This water is being made available by the Donald Trump campaign"".  Would you accept it?

Now if the MAGA group wants to setup a booth 200 ft from the polling place, right alongside the BLM booth, and make water available for people, that is perfectly legal.  And if an elector wants to step out of line and go get a bottle of water, that is legal too.  But if the water had a label like I said above, well that would prohibit as it would be brining campaign materials into the line which also is not allowed.

No one is prohibited from having water in line, which is the impression so many in the media and on these forums are trying to paint, but that is completely false.  People who are standing in line can have water, it just can't be given to them if they are closer than 150 ft from the polling place by any group accept the poll workers.

If you think Kamala and Biden have completely revamped their views on the Black community for example, then you’re deluded. I’m Black and I know that Biden has been historically bad for Black rights. Kamala is responsible for countless black men rotting in jail on minimal charges. Under Trump Black communities did better.

Biden inherited the issue that the Left crucified Trump over, he has done nothing to correct it but yet we aren’t seeing the total condemnation that the right and Trump got.

"I didn't know you were the guy calling the shots of what is a Republican ideal or not... for example, Lincoln, a Republican, tried to end slavery and almost fully succeeded, except Democrats kept slavery for prisoners. 

But how many Republicans actually support amending the 13th amendment to fully abolish slavery? Surely that would be as Republican as it can be.

For example, now, unlike the 19th century, there are a few Democrats that support a bill to fix the 13th amendment to fully abolish slavery in the US in all its forms. How many Republicans do you think support that bill?

"During his first 100 days, didn't he say he was gonna build the wall?

&gt;He reversed his position on a number of issues including labeling China as a currency manipulator, NATO, launching the 2017 Shayrat missile strike, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), renomination of Janet Yellen as Chair of the Federal Reserve, and the nomination of Export-Import Bank directors. Trump's approval among his base was high, with 96% of those who voted for him saying in an April 2017 poll that they would vote for him again.

&gt;Near the end of the 100 days, the Trump administration introduced a broad outline of a sweeping tax reform focusing on deep tax cuts. Although Trump had to concede to delay funding for the U.S.–Mexico border wall he had promised, narrowly avoiding a government shutdown a few days before the end of the first 100 days.

Also:

&gt;The United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019 occurred from midnight EST on December 22, 2018, until January 25, 2019 (35 days). It was the longest U.S. government shutdown in history and the second federal government shutdown involving furloughs during the presidency of Donald Trump.

And:

&gt;Trump visited Trump-owned golf courses 92 times between becoming president in January 2017 and January 3, 2018, although the White House does not disclose when the president actually plays golf during a visit to a golf course. And the White House has on some occasions denied that Trump played golf during his visits even after photos published on social media showed him playing golf.

Why would the white House deny he was golfing when he was? Surely they would be thrilled to admit he was golfing if he was working at the same time.

"You are making the incorrect assumption that I am an American. Actually I am a Canadian who has spent a lot of time studying the effects of gun control (ehick is why I posted a study for your review). I understand both US and UK culture, having had grandparents who were immigrants and friends who are American. 
Americans rejected the British Crown as couple of hundred years ago, drove them back to Britain, and forged what is arguably the best country in the world out of a vast wilderness.
In regards to ""mass shootings"" in the USA, most of them take place in inner city neighborhoods as a result of gang warfare. Convicted felons are not allowed to possess firearms, but criminals do not follow laws.
In Toronto, where I live, gun licenses are required in order to possess guns, but thousands of rounds are fired each year by criminal gangs and daytime gunfights are not much of a surprise anymore. Illegal guns are easier to get than legal ones. Canada's strict gun control laws has created a lucrative black market and smuggling is extremely profitable. 
In my view, based upon research and personal observations, gun bans only disarm the law abiding while empowering violent criminals.
Can the US system be improved? Likely, but I would rather live under the US system than the UK one.

Don't agree with your second point though. In Aus everything is going well and they shut it down harder than pretty much anyone else. House market is booming. Unemployment is down.

"Lockdowns work dude. I'm Australian. I was there for the lock down and now I have moved to Amsterdam where people say the same thing as you just did... Lockdowns don't work...

But what people are doing here and what the US seems to have done aren't lockdowns. When I was in Aus for the lockdowns, police would ask people sitting alone on the beach what they were doing as if they werent exercising they were allowed outside.

They also did it at the beginning of COVID so the case levels could be managed and they eradicated the virus, not just reduced its spread. The virus is exponentisl both ways. If you do these half lockdowns to slow the rate, you have put in all the hardwork without reaping the rewards. As when the virus starts the slow down, a extra week makes a huge difference in reducing the active cases.

Multiple courts examined trump's claims of voter fraud and threw them out, contrary to what trump has been saying that courts did not examine the evidence.

You asked for evidence of the claim I made.  I provided it, and then pointed out there had been additional cases won since.  The source was fine, but here is one of the cases that was won since the spreadsheet was last updated.

That's precisely what it shows.  When cases are dismissed before evidence is considered, then the evidence was not considered in them.

You can, actually.  See the suits against Jack Phillips for how that works when activists don't like that courts keep ruling against them.

As for Trump's economy... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy_of_the_Donald_Trump_administration

just look at the first graph. really looks like trump did a lot to change that trajectory, huh? it's really sad he had to have tax cuts just to keep things heading in the same direction Obama put them on.

I take it you've heard of the federal interest rate? Trump did a lot to inject the economy. Your last line is ironic af, because you're accusing me exactly of what you're doing. I think they call that projecting?

"No. Election fraud would theoretically turn up in one of the extensive audits  that were done after the 2020 election, but none did because the system is secure.  Double-votes, wrong-district voting, and dead people voting all get weeded out.  If it's close enough for a recount, it's recounted.  If someone demands an audit (as Trump did. a lot) then it gets audited and checked.

If no evidence of fraud comes out of ALL OF THAT, then chances are voter fraud is pretty slim.  There have been extensive studies over years on the prevalence of voter fraud and the resounding evidence is that voter fraud has a negligible effect even in mail-in states.

It's just a non-issue.  Trump had big tantrums about it to sow distrust, and clearly that has worked, but the fact is NO evidence of voter fraud were found.  If Georgia could have found any - they would have!

"&gt; I don't think you're racist, sexist, or any other kind of bigot, but you don't have to be any of those things. All you have to do is vote for people who are willing to use violence to maintain the oppressive systems that hurt people of color, women, poor people, and other minorities.

So, Democrats.

Remember that the Democrats were the ones who seceded and started a war to preserve slavery.

After they lost and could no longer prevent minorities from voting or running for political office, the first minority Congressmen and Senators were Republicans.

After the end of Reconstruction in 1874, the same Democrats who seceded to preserve slavery got right back into power and created the black codes and Jim Crow - and that ended any participation by minorities in politics for decades.

When women got the vote in the early 1900s, they too were Republicans - because they knew who had fought for them and who had fought against them.

It was Democrat President Woodrow Wilson who re-segregated the Federal government, and who showed the KKK film ""Birth of a Nation"" as the first film shown in the White House.

When the US Supreme Court overturned ""Separate but Equal"" in 1954, it was Democrat-run states who refused to abide by the decision.

In 1957, when the (Democrat) Arkansas governor refused to allow black children to go to an all white school, and called out the National Guard to prevent it, it was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower who called out Federal Troops to enforce school desegregation.

Here's what Lyndon B Johnson had to say about the Civil Rights Act of 1957: 

&gt; “These Negroes, they're getting pretty uppity these days and that's a problem for us since they've got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now we've got to do something about this, we've got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference. For if we don't move at all, then their allies will line up against us and there'll be no way of stopping them, we'll lose the filibuster and there'll be no way of putting a brake on all sorts of wild legislation. It'll be Reconstruction all over again.""

When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 finally passed, after decades of Democrats preventing similar bills from coming to a vote (and their having watered down the Civil Rights Act of 1957), it was after 13 Senators filibustered it for nearly 2 months.  12 of those Senators were Democrats, and one of them - Exalted Cyclops Senator Robert Byrd, died in office in 2010, as the longest serving Senator.  It passed with a greater percentage of Republican votes than Democrat votes in both the House and Senate.  After it passed, the only Senators to lose their seats in the next 2 elections were Republicans who voted against it, and Democrats who voted for it.

When states continued to have segregated schools through the 1970s and 1980s, it was (then-Senator) Joe Biden who argued against busing to desegregate schools, saying:

&gt; ""Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle""

...and in the present, many of the cities where it is being argued there is ""systemic racism"" have been run by Democratic politicians for half a century or more - in some cases, all the way back to the end of Reconstruction in 1874.

So yes - if you're voting for Democrats, you're voting for the people who created and maintain those systems you hate.",1616878038.0,gsi82hm,t1_gsh7thr,/r/Republican/comments/meespc/uk_university_to_unveil_32k_greta_thunberg_statue/gsi82hm/,1.0,1616892438.0,"gt, kind, bigot, things, vote, people, violence, systems, color, women, minorities, t1_gsh7thr, ones, war, slavery, office, minority, Congressmen, end, power, codes, participation, politics, decades, 1900s, government, film, Birth, Nation, states, decision, governor, children, school, desegregation, uppity, days, problem, pull, uppityness, difference, allies, way, filibuster, brake, sorts, legislation, bills, Senators, months, percentage, votes, seats, elections, schools, 1970s, 1980s, jungle, present, cities, racism, politicians, century, cases",0.38773911273911277,0.03172059422059422,0.0

"Trump disbanded his own commission into the fraud after two years, because they couldn't find anything.  Even Republican states were refusing to hand over the data which Trump requested. because he wanted your S.S. numbers, military records, prison records and more.  Deep red states admitted that was a dramatic over reach.  The truth is known, there wasn't 2-3 million illegal votes in 2016.  Just like they won't find anymore than maybe a dozen illegal votes in 2020 (funny part, the illegal votes they have found were often for Trump).  I advocate acting responsibly, and not making ridiculous declarations if you're still running investigations.  Instead, local parties are trying to shove over 350 new voter laws through before the mid terms.  Making it illegal to give water at voting sites is going to play really well in future textbooks.  I'm sure it's going to prevent a lot of voter fraud.

I know here in Utah, our legislature passed a $100 million tax cut.  Then the federal COVID bill passed.  Then a few stories made the rounds saying we'd lose an additional $100 million in funding because we gave a $100 million tax cut.  

The devil is in the details, I'm not sure if the federal COVID bill allows states to make tax cuts if they can prove these cuts are NOT funded by the federal funds.  If the COVID bill does, then states are ok.  If not, it's likely unconstitutional like forced Medicaid expansion was.",1615995740.0,gr8wymz,t3_m6yqme,/r/Republican/comments/m6yqme/21_republican_states_threaten_legal_action/gr8wymz/,1.0,1616010140.0,"t3_m6yqme, government, states, tax, cuts, expansion, funding, legislature, cut, bill, stories, rounds, devil, details, funds",0.5477777777777778,0.13944444444444443,0.0

"Not so much Pelosi.  There is a bit of a civil war in the Dem party right now.  She (and other establishment Dems) are tolerated at best. 

The DNC leadership that inherited the reigns after Donna Brazile and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (but still have the same goals as those two architects).  It has nothing to do with Biden's ""decline"" and everything to do with the same reasons ""Hillary at any cost"" was the motto.   Tom Perez wasn't 100% onboard with that.  Their hope is that Jamie Harrison handles the lobbying efforts (as he was a big dog a Podesta) but ""toes the line"" unlike Perez (who was in favor of attracting the Bernie Supporters into the mainstream DNC after 2016).  We saw how that worked out, yeah?

Any discussion about the Dems MUST start with the DNC leadership.  This has been the dog wagging the tail since BHO left office--perhaps before.

"Man you’re dense. 

Trumps policies are in place and we’re seeing unprecedented spikes.

Biden rolls back Trump’s policies and we continue to see massive spikes. 

Obviously something isn’t adding up. Almost like regardless of which policies are in place, a large spike in immigration was going to occur.

 “When asked what he thought was driving the trend, Miller said, “There’s certainly economic instability in the region that’s unparalleled.”

“All you have to do is look at the pandemic … the COVID rate infections down in South and Central America,” he said. “We recently had a hurricane, continued violence, unemployment. So if you put all those issues together, … you’re going to see folks looking for a better way of life.”

Miller said he wanted to be clear that the border is not “open” and that migrants shouldn’t listen to human smugglers who are saying otherwise.”

"Thank you for being respectful in your comment and being civil, that’s not common with a lot of Democrats or liberals if you are one, I don’t want to assume.

One thing I noticed that you said is that IDs are not widely available but technically they are. In most states the usual identification people use is a state ID or a drivers license which is not that expensive, definitely less than $100 in most places. Also some places even allow birth certificates to vote, something is every citizen is given for free, when they’re born so technically everyone has at least one form of ID.

But with the bill Democrats are passing: HR 1 will remove all voter security laws and is terrible for a democracy. I’m not sure if you’re aware of what’s in the HR 1 bill but it includes: reducing voting registration age to 16, removing voter ID requirements before voting, blocks polling places from verifying each vote casted, and a lot of other terrible changes that undermine our election integrity.

After the mess that was the 2020 election and multiple cases and allegations of fraud we should be tightening our election security not reducing it. Identifications are nowhere near expensive as Democrats are making it out to be and I believe they are using the narrative that identifications are too expensive for minorities to afford which they are definitely not.

"It's reddit.  I don't remember exactly how I came your comment.  It's sort of like a wiki walk where you start by looking up the history of the microprocessor and three hours later end up on a page describing the battle of the bulge. 

Anyhow, I'd be fine with requiring IDs if they were available for free to all citizens.  As in most places, it costs money to get a state ID, I currently would consider them a poll tax. 

Regardless, the truth of the matter is though that the actual prevalence of non-citizens using actual citizens' registrations to vote appears to be infinitesimal, which means that this argument we're having is pretty much a way for people in power to keep us from thinking about or arguing issues of actual import surrounding voting and choosing our representatives, these are things like: 

1. Gerrymandering
2. Using first-past-the-post in most places vs. alternatives like ranked choice
3. Whether term limits should be imposed for all elected offices
4. Who should be elected vs. appointed
5. Switching to a method of campaign funding that is either wholely publicly funded or at least putting much greater restrictions on campaign finance, including limiting the time period when politicians can campaign, restricting PACs, and forcing all donations to any political organization over a certain amount to be part of the public record (i.e., making donors name the selves amd getting rid of dark money)
6. Allowing DC and Puerto Rico to become states (they want to, but they won't be let in because they are both more liberal and it would further diminish the power of the Republican party)
7. Automatic voter registration (using tax records, vital records, etc.)
8. Abolishing the electoral college
9. Abolishing the filibuster

Note that I'm not necessarily taking a position on the items listed above or below, but each of them is far more important to discuss regarding ensuring the integrity of our democracy than voter ID laws. 

And even some ideas currently outside the Overton window:
1. Whether voting is preferable to choosing representation by lot
2. Implementing direct democracy more widely amd with fewer hoops to jump through (i.e., expanding the use of referenda
3. Abolishing the senate (or making it proportional to population as well) 

The bill being put forward now deals with some of these things as well. Some of the issues involved, like creating bipartisan or apolitical commitees to define congressional districts to end gerrymandering, are mainly common sense changes to make things more fair. Thus, it's more difficult to come up with an argument against them other than ""I want to win at all costs even if it means that I have to manipulate the system so that our representation isn't actually proportional."" 

But who needs an argument when we simply can convince people to squabble about voter ID laws (which solve a nonexistent problem and disenfranchises many)? 

What really bothers me is that most of the arguments against this bill are being argued in bad faith.  It's not a coincidence that the sides being taken on this bill are clearly separated among party lines. 

The truth is that by any actual measure, Republicans and conservatives are in the minority, and that the party is getting proportionally smaller.  The two biggest tools they have used to maintain power illegimately are by making it more difficult for people who disagree with them to vote (making mail-in voting harder, reducing the number of polling places in areas that are more liberal, reducing the availability of early in-person voting, creating stringent voter ID laws, not allowing college students to vote at the district in which their college is,etc.), and by making the votes of those people count less (gerrymandering, i.e. ""cracking and packing,"" and the electoral college). 

This is not to say that Democrats haven't done or tried to do the same when they were in power in certain instances, but the fact that they're willing to forgo things such as gerrymandering shows to me that they are willing to concede a tool that could be used by them to gain an unfair advantage.  We also see that, although they could do it in order to pack the court or push through laws without a single Republican on board, they're not willing to abolish the filibuster (whereas the Republicans had no problem doing that in order to push through justices).  Altogether this indicates to me that one party is arguing and legislating in good faith whereas the other isn't.

The real question I have is whether the people who are against provisions of this bill, like getting rid of gerrymandering, are doing so because they honestly believe that this bill will make our democracy less fair, or because they value winning over fair representation.  It's clear where Republican politicians stand — they don't give a shit about fair representation — but I think the average Joe Republican has convinced themselves that their party leaders are making this argument in good faith even though the last ten years seem to prove otherwise.

"I'll gladly answer. The explanation is pretty simple and was expected long before the election including in wisconsin. 

This is from a WPR article, link underneath.

""Absentee ballots take longer to process than ballots cast in person on Election Day. That’s because absentee ballot envelopes need to be checked against poll books and checked for voter signature, voter address and witness signature requirements before they’re opened. After they’re unsealed, ballots must be smoothed out before they’re fed into tabulating machines. If any ballots are damaged or the machine won’t accept them because they’re too rumpled or creased, the ballot will need to be re-created by poll workers in a time-consuming process dictated by state law.""

https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-election-officials-say-vote-counting-will-take-longer-year-heres-what-expect

Wisconsin also happens to be one of the few states that doesn't allow the processing of absentee ballots until election day which significantly draws out the process to the point that it is unreasonable to expect results on election night during an election with historic levels of absentee voting. It also means your state takes longer to obtain results than most states.

Combine those 2 factors (can't count until day of election plus a time consuming counting process) and you have yourself a process that will not bring results for days after the election.

If that's your evidence for a rigged election it is simply not enough, not to mention easily explained. Actual proof is necessary and would have surfaced long ago by now if it were legit. Anyone who is slightly skeptical doesn't buy into this conspiracy theory.",1615912990.0,gr512oq,t1_gr4xgn8,/r/Republican/comments/m5u17w/interesting_comparison/gr512oq/,1.0,1615927390.0,"explanation, election, wisconsin, t1_gr4xgn8, article, ballots, person, absentee, ballot, envelopes, poll, books, voter, signature, address, requirements, tabulating, machines, machine, workers, time, process, state, law, states, processing, day, point, results, night, levels, voting, factors, counting, days, evidence, proof, conspiracy, theory",0.531031746031746,0.07722222222222222,0.0

"He is part of the establishment corruption enriching his family through his political connections, he called for the invasion of the middle east years before 9/11, he championed the crime bill that targeted minorities, when he was Vice President he built the cages Republicans and Trump are now being branded as racists and shoving children into, and furthermore he's incapable of his position and is very clearly doing what someone is telling him to, most tellingly of this if you don't believe and refuse to see any of the videos where he admits he doesn't actually know what he signs for or that he gets confused about where he is would be that he hasn't held a SOTU yet and when he did offer to take questions, someone cut his feed, some silenced the president of the United States. Also, let's not forget that when prompted about the genocide currently going on in China, Biden shrugged it off.

Also, Trump didn't ignore the science, he was literally one of the first people to warn America about Covid in the SOTU Address that nobody paid attention to because Nancy Pelosi stole the spot light, and then when he dropped it because all the info he saw on it was that it was just a particularly nasty flu, suddenly it was a pandemic, that was the hoax, that suddenly it's a major problem when they can use it to stick it to Trump and lock down the country and make people dependent upon the government. His Foreign Policy moves were actually historic with beginning the process of freeing North Korea of being the Hermit Kingdom and taking us out of deals that didn't benefit us and other countries weren't putting forth the effort, and he tried to pull soldiers out of the Middle East, but then Military Officials lied so that they could keep soldiers in the Middle East. He primarily told the American people what Fauci told him, which apparently when Trump tells it he's a monster and when Fauci comes and says it he's a literal saint.

A big thing that some of these Democrat group leaders murmur about is the Republican Love Bomb, and it actually shows the major divide that should expose something to people. You go to a Trump Rally with a different opinion and want to talk to them about it, people will talk to you, I can pull an example where an Antifa dude was at a counter protest for a Trump rally, ready to punch what he thought were Nazis, marched across the street, and then talked to a black guy about how the right are racists and they had a conversation, and suddenly he was a member of the Trump Rally. With groups like BLM you go try to talk to somebody like a cop, someone will rush up, tell you not to talk to them, and start screaming at the cop.

"[To be fair, urban counties do pay far more taxes than rural ones and receive less subsidization per capita.](https://www.ibj.com/articles/15690-study-urban-tax-money-subsidizes-rural-counties)

&gt; Overall, taxpayers in 46 metropolitan counties paid 82.5 percent of the taxes, or $11.3 billion, and received
76.7 percent, or $10.5 billion in expenditures, the study said.
The disparity is equally pronounced in the 10-county
Indianapolis metropolitan area. Residents there paid 33.5 percent, or $4.6 billion, of total state taxes and received 28 percent,
or $3.8 billion, back.
Still, William J. Rieber, an economics professor at Butler University’s College of
Business, said the method in which states distribute tax dollars is justified.
“Rural areas don’t
have the same infrastructure as urban areas do, so they often need additional help,” Rieber said. “To some extent, we’re in the same state, and we’re all in this together.”
The Indiana study is consistent with
the results from other states that examined the distribution of state government finances, the fiscal policy institute said

Why did no democratic state what verified mail in ballots, yet now California (one of the biggest blue states) is demanding verified ID on signatures trying to force the Governor out of position?

Since we all were waring mask and social distancing long before Biden took office and the vaccine not only was found under Trumps administration he helped build the distribution network so everyone would get it as fast as possible. In return I was answered with show proof of that. So I left the group. I blocked the comments then my account was followed by the 2 people that was arguing with me over showing proof.

"What do you mean ""economy"" as I and the above were talking about unemployment, you respond with economy? What are you defining as ""economy?""

The GDP growth has averaged between 0-3% per term per president since Nixon.  After the Great Recession, under Obama it did exactly that, and returned to the average.  The average under Obama was 1.6%, under Trump .95%. Some quarters under Obama had nearly 6% growth, others -1% growth.  Under Trump, between 1-3% growth. 

I'm fact total GDP trajectory is nearly identical through Obama's first term, second term, and trump's only term.

Unemployment % was reduced by half through Obama's 2 terms. Trump reduced unemployment % by 1/3 (excluding pandemic).

Inflation was marginally better under Obama, while the stock market was marginally better under Trump.  But neither of those reflect the economy very well, or one is more an indicator of how the poor are doing, the other how the wealthy are respectively.

"I love it.   Link another Trump press release to prove your point and hope no one reads it.

Insult and personal attack more but it won’t change the truth.

Who cut the taxes and jacked up spending?  Who cut Fed funds rate and restarted QE?    Trump.

Who used all the federal tools to fight recession foolishly leaving nothing left but deficit spending.  Trump!

Nancy wanted a larger stimulus bill because it was needed.   

Trump signed [2.2 trillion dollar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_Aid,_Relief,_and_Economic_Security_Act) Cares Act in March.  The [434 billion dollar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_Protection_Program_and_Health_Care_Enhancement_Act) PPP bill in April. The additional [330 billion dollars](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_Protection_Program#Paycheck_Protection_Program_Flexibility_Act_of_2020) PPP in June.   Another 900 Billion in December.

I love that your pointing to a lost argument by Nancy and saying it would be worse...

But the point your trying to Gish gallop from is that Trump caused the inflation we are seeing today.

3.8 trillion dollars in deficit spending and money printing in 2020!  Monetary supply inflation!
Billions in cost push inflation from tariffs!   1.9 trillion in monetary inflation from tax cuts!

"&gt;As one would expect coming off a recession

That's what I'm saying, unemployment drops nearly every year after a recession. It has little to with Trump or Obama's (or whoever else you want to whatabout with) recovery efforts or lack thereof.

&gt;and yet, Obama had the worst economic recovery coming off a recession of any President, ever.

As one would expect coming off the worst recession since the great depression? ...until the one we're currently in.

But really the great recession began in 2007, and peaked in 2008.

You do realize Obama wasn't president until 2009, right? And that recovery efforts began under the Bush administration?

"Or move to a school district with great public schools with a specific demographic background. Growing up we lived in a town that had amazing public schools and was about 1/3 Asian immigrants, 1/3 Indian immigrants and the other third mixed bag of European immigrants and “mayflower” Americans. 

The academic air in town was palpable with strong dedication to learning achievement and career goals. Specifically the large number of Indian and Asian parents influence on their kids and the school via PTA’s and community programs made it a culture in town of study hard, work harder, and make something of yourself. Study study study - but also Friday night lights. The high percentage of immigrant families (or at least with immigrant parents and first generation children) prevented crt and wokeism from percolating into the schools. I’m young, and the social justice movements were young but well-and-alive when I was in grade school, but I was literally oblivious to it. College orientation hit me like a firehouse wielded by an orthodox orangutan from Mars. I was actually sooooooo confused. So lost I couldn’t even be outraged. I remember one day at orientation we did the whole whitenprivlige song and dance and I just didn’t understand. I kept asking questions in honest naivety and innocence as I couldn’t wrap my head around it. The immediate past 18 years of my life at that point was spent in a large immigrant community from europe and Asia / South Asia where there was 0..ZERO racial or cultural tensions and where the immigrants lived in their nice houses and had fancy jobs on those big boy work visas, and the multi generation Americans were mixed were very much small town America: lower-middle class. Judging from my Facebook now 12 years removed from high school - it appears most of my high school friends (yes even the Liberal ones) still have not bought into most race-based social justice issues and the ones who do wokeism reject the race baiting and focus more of wealth inequality or the environment or some other tangential thing",1615735460.0,gqwjtnh,t1_gqvtila,/r/Republican/comments/m4m27e/this_is_what_one_liberal_school_is_teaching_kids/gqwjtnh/,1.0,1615749860.0,"school, district, schools, background, town, immigrants, bag, t1_gqvtila, air, dedication, achievement, career, goals, number, parents, kids, community, programs, culture, study, Study, night, lights, percentage, families, generation, children, crt, wokeism, justice, movements, grade, College, orientation, firehouse, orangutan, day, whitenprivlige, song, dance, questions, naivety, innocence, head, years, life, point, europe, tensions, houses, jobs, boy, work, visas, class, friends, ones, race, issues, wealth, inequality, environment, thing",0.36879870129870124,0.07311147186147186,0.0

"Thank you for your insight. I do agree that not all people stand to benefit from political economic decisions, but the majority should and I don't believe that this is the case here. Small businesses are a major factor in determining the US economic status. A small business is defined in economics as having fewer than 500 employees.

""Over 99 percent of America’s 28.7 million firms are small businesses. The vast majority (88 percent) of employer firms have fewer than 20 employees, and nearly 40 percent of all enterprises have under $100k in revenue.""

https://www.jpmorganchase.com/institute/research/small-business/small-business-dashboard/economic-activity

That is a lot of businesses that would be facing a very stressful and bleak future if the federal government raises the minimum wage to $15/hr over a short period of time. I am having difficulties understanding exactly how this decision would benefit the majority of Americans. I foresee a  plethora of unhealthy inflation ultimately devaluing the US dollar beyond repair. That raises the issue that the folks (senior citizens on a fixed budget) who receive social security will struggle quite a bit. Many of them are barely making it just on social security income. The amount the money that the federal government would have to pay out just to keep this larger demographic afloat would be astronomical. Where is the incentive for younger generations to save their money for their future after witnessing this first hand? I believe we would feel the negative effects of the outrageous minimum wage increase for many many years to come. I believe minimum wage should be increased incrementally and by the states at a much slower rate. This would allow for a slow rate of inflation and more money in people's pocket. If some of the states were effected too negatively at first, the wage increase could be slowed or halted temporarily until those states could recover. The federal mandated increase does not account for this. Instead, it seems to me as though their mentality is what's good for one is good for all and that simply isn't true. Proof of this is different costs if living between the different states.

Inflation isn't a ""bad word"" either. A slow and steady rate of inflation is a key indicator of a healthy economy with acceptable growth. The effects of inflation can generally be described in one sentence. A dollar today is worth less than a dollar tomorrow. The issue I have with the proposed wage hike is that it is too high of an increase over the proposed time frame established by the federal government. Also, I do believe that the minimum wage in my state of Pennsylvania is too low for a person to survive on for an extended period of time. What is the best decision for the future of the US economy?

I will add and end with one positive that I can see that would transpire from the proposed $15/hr minimum wage increase. The high rate of inflation would cause the current US national debt to not be as significant meaning that it would be easier to payoff because of devaluation of the currency.

3.5 percent unemployment while crying for a weaker dollar and loose money supply.  

He literally demanded the inflation we see today on his Twitter!

It was short sighted.  Taking away the fiscal ability for the government to respond to a crisis by juicing a hot economy with tax cuts, printing money, cutting fed rates, and then making it worse by adding tariffs more than make up any good from regulation cuts.    

Then a real crisis arrived a year later and the only tool left is massive deficit spending.  Trump caused this and the facts from conservative think tanks, stats from the Fed, and any basic economic knowledge proves it.

Either way, Biden isn’t pushing to cut the easy money, he is actually doing the opposite ramping up money production through government spending. They already admitted to wanting to do another $3 trillion in infrastructure and another $4-9 trillion in a Green Energy Plan (which has failed in Germany). 

The economy wasn’t at 2 percent, it was 4% or are you going to call that a press release and dismiss it.  You keep getting caught making up things or using left wing sources that under play the facts. We are done here.

"So your gotcha link is a press release by a politician trying to help his boss when re-election?  One that takes 4 years of regulation cuts and adds them up to 90 billion?

90 divided by 4 is $22.5 billion.   Fail to see what this proves even if you chose to believe it over the links provided by me that actually show you the math.

Second point.

You want to talk about inflation but ***you brought up regulation cuts and the savings to consumers.* ** Increased regulations cause inflation.    

They do increase costs to businesses and one assumes those costs would pass to a consumer but that’s not inflation.  Cost-push inflation.  Fair game.


If regulatory costs increases on consumers are a fair topic than why not tariffs.  They also increase costs on businesses that are then assumed to be passed to consumers.    Cost-push inflation. Fair game.

Is it because tariffs don’t fit comfortably into your ‘Biden bad’ for consumer costs worldview?

Fine.  Let’s talk inflation from loose monetary policy.  

Your really going to hate how the rest of this goes then.

Monetary policy under Trump directly caused the inflation you are seeing today.   Sure, the problem has festered for decades but he specifically demanded the inflation we are seeing now.

"No, inflation is coming because we have been inflating our currency since 1913 and have ramped it up especially high in 2008 and Trump didn’t fight to stop the spending very much, but every spending bill was expanded by Congress and then when the Democrats took the House in 2019, they demanded even more than what Trump wanted to spend. 


Companies hedge risk and as soon as Biden was declared the winner, oil companies started hedging higher regulatory costs and limited new permits. Two of the 3 oil field workers at my gym were laid off by December and it is only getting worse here in the oil county. 

This is why gas will spike quickly and lower slowly, because companies are hedging the risk. 

You can go back through my post history and see I have complained about spending my entire time. You can also see me argue that apart from inflation, the biggest driver for increased prices is government policies.

"liberals have found a loophole in our constitution. When the founding fathers wrote the Constitution they didn't imagine that a handful of giant mega corporations would be able to control 90% of the speech and Free Press in the world..

At the time that they wrote the Constitution the biggest threat to free speech and in fact the only threat to free speech WAS the government..

there was no Facebook or Twitter or youtube.. there was no internet or cable news. And the entire media apparatus was not owned by three companies..

They could have never imagined a situation where an entity other than the government would be capable of censoring hundreds of millions of Americans and controlling what people could talk about.. the spirit of the first amendment was that everybody should be able to say what they want and the Press should be able to report how they want..

if the founding fathers had known that one day there would be three mega corporation social media outlets controlling 90% of speech and deciding whether a News Network would survive or go bankrupt then they would have included that the government must mandate all companies to allow Free Speech as well..

The last thing they wanted was for the American people to be restricted by anyone.. not just the government..

Liberals found a little loophole. Because the founding fathers didn't realize that Facebook was exist the first amendment only ever stop the government from censoring you..

And liberals exploit that loophole to make sure that they can still censor you..

Obvious solution is to do what the founding fathers asked us to do: Amen to the constitution.. the founding fathers may have not been able to realize Facebook would eventually exist but they did predict that things would change in their country and that the constitution would not always be 100% relevantt throughout changing times.

realize that times change and a constitution written in 1776 might not be adequate for the country 100 years later..

and so they created a way to fix that.. it was the ability to amend the constitution.. they knew that someday the Constitution would need to be changed a little bit in order to be relevant to the times.. and so they created the ability to create constitutional amendments. To add or change the Constitution when it becomes necessary..

They might not have been able to know about Facebook but they did know that something like Facebook would happen. And so they gave the government the ability to add to the Constitution for when it did..

"Did you think beneficial_judge was me? 

Two things. 1. If you're genuinely interested in looking at information from opposing points of view, I'm willing to provide sources. I'm not going to waste my time showing connections between Republicans, racists, and the alt-right if you have no interest in reviewing it with the possibility of changing your mindset. 

2. The amount of time for someone to respond shouldn't have a bearing on the apparent validity of the response. It takes much more time to source unbiased information and develop a coherent, evidence backed response than it does to post unverified info. And I have other stuff that I deem much more important than providing evidence of how the Republican party is cozied with racists to someone that hasn't noticed it already.

Before I post anything more substantial, look at the groups attending Unite the Right and any other pro-Trump or ""Stop the Steal"" rallies. Look at the Unite the Right wikipedia page, check the footnotes, and go to the sources for information about the groups in attendance.

"Lol funny but I’m not triggered at all all I give are the facts witch the left is not doing I’m a Republican trans women and I’m part of the far right LGBTQ community people who support trump and republicans and call out the far leftist LGBTQ community for being a nut house isn’t it funny there was actually something in the dark web that showed 80% of straight men would date a far right trans women and not a far leftists trans women because far right trans women are not crazy people sure some of us may have that bad girl attude and have psychopathic personality but that’s personality not cazyness and we always call out actvest if you look away from the media you can see the far right LGBTQ community is so much more peaceful and loving than the far leftist LGBTQ community here’s some examples of far right LGBTQ community movements

Here’s some movements examples from the far leftist LGBTQ community 

#datemeoryourtransphobic 
#BLM
#Straightmenareevil

You see the deference in the 2 community’s so why do you think far right trans women are more accepted in to society these days it has nothing to do with being trans it has to do with the way the community treats people and the far right trans community has treated people with respect we respect religion and freedom of speech and on condom actual illegal hate speech not protected under the constitution such as death threats and hate discrimination such as (being fired for being trans or in LGBTQ, being refused service and being attacked or bullied)

The leftist focuses on that but they also focus on stupid stuff like (being force to massage someone’s balls in a female gentle massage place ,being forced to date someone even though you don’t want to ,legalization of child molestion ,legalization of child pornography, and being forced to let someone have sex with a cat or dog because they identify as one",1615593146.0,gqqxaqf,t1_gqjosko,/r/Republican/comments/lzyl1d/the_proverbial_shooting_ones_self_in_the_foot/gqqxaqf/,1.0,1615607546.0,"facts, left, women, part, t1_gqjosko, community, people, trump, republicans, nut, house, web, %, men, trans, leftists, girl, attude, personality, cazyness, media, examples, movements, walkaway, antimuslimreligionmovement, superstraight, datemeoryourtransphobic, Straightmenareevil, transspeciesmovement, deference, society, days, way, respect, religion, freedom, speech, condom, hate, constitution, death, threats, discrimination, service, stuff, force, balls, massage, place, date, legalization, child, molestion, pornography, sex, cat, dog",0.6685579196217495,0.05851063829787234,0.0

Because only then can we hold the media and the elected officials, and anyone in ""power"", accountable.

Expanded family leave and sick leave that will pay up to 73k per individual annually. 

Expanded unemployment insurance to pay an extra $400 per week on top of state benefits. 

So yes, the pig is the Democrat voter. Those of us in red states that have opened up based on the data will be holding the bill for those in states who are not allowed to work still because of state regulations.

"On Royal title 

[Thanks to King George V's 1917 decree, only the oldest son of the Prince of Wales' oldest son (Prince William) is entitled to be called His Royal Highness or Prince. That means that only Prince George, not his siblings or cousins, is supposed to be called a prince.  However, the Queen intervened on behalf of Prince George's younger siblings in 2012 and issued a new Letters Patent, which gave all of the future monarch's children the right to be called princes and princesses.  In Harry's case, the Queen didn't change the rules again to allow his children to be referred to as His or Her Royal Highness and a prince or princess. Since Archie is not the descendant of a direct heir to the throne, he therefore does not inherit a title, according to the 1917 patent](https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/entertainment/why-does-harry-and-meghan-s-son-archie-not-have-a-royal-title-1.5338887)

&gt;Allowing on-premises dining at restaurants was associated with 0.9 (p = 0.02), 1.2 (p&lt;0.01), and 1.1 (p = 0.04) percentage point increases in the case growth rate 41–60, 61–80, and 81–100 days, respectively, after restrictions were lifted (Table 2) (Figure).

This is incorrect. The findings are *daily*, and in *growth rate percentage points*, so the 2% is compounding daily. It's the same math that lets you carve decades off a mortgage with small additional payments, but it cuts even harder because the pandemic was growth was exponential. 

Near its worst, in March 2020, daily COVID death rates were growing by 10-15%.

Obama's DACA program is a good example.  He spent years saying it wouldn't be Constitutional for him to do it, and that it would require Congressional action - but when they refused, he did it himself anyway.

The courts will only rule it unconstitutional, maybe, if someone sues, and they have standing.  Even then, it depends on the court that hears the case.  In the case of DACA, when Trump tried to get rid of it, SCOTUS ruled that the program was improper and that Trump had the authority to get rid of it - but stopped him from doing so because they didn't like his reasoning.

And now it is the oppression from royal family. What a load of bullshit. She knew what she was getting into. And now she comes out and openly accuses the family of racism. Gimme a break. If they were actually the racists and the monarchs would she even be allowed to wed into their family. And add to that even Harry talk about being suffocated and what not. Really? Did the suffocation start after your marriage or were you always suffocated? And you say even the other men are suffocated? What the hell.

No they didn’t. That was a claim made by Steve Banon that was later proven false.

The FBI has never claimed that.

Okay?


&gt;That said, FBI has lost credibility several times over. They had the laptop during 1st impeachment in which the claim was that Trump was seeking a false investigation against Biden. They kept the laptop secret knowing it revealed pay to play schemes in Ukraine.

The FBI has never claimed that the laptop is Biden’s and they have never disclosed the contents of the laptop. So far all the information we have about the laptop has come from Trump, his legal team, and his associates, and they have every reason to lie.

"One last response, I know this is a complete waste of time but you’ve once again ignored reality and gotten unarguable facts jumbled up:

I never asked if there was evidence of cheating. Check your facts. That’s your false reality version of what is happening. 

What actually happened: I explained how the burden of proof works in this scenario. That’s where I jumped into the mix. I’ve never asked for evidence of cheating. Although to prove that the claim that it DID happen, evidence would be needed. Nobody has evidence, so there is therefore no merit to the claim.

I never claimed anything about legitimate authority to govern. This is, again, your false reality of what happened. If you simply look upward in the thread and read the words that I have typed, it’s obvious to anyone grounded in reality that I did not say anything of the sort. 

I never claimed to have “won property” or properly. I explained how the burden of proof works. 

Going over the EXACT scenario one last time (not a straw man, the EXACT SAME SCENARIO THAT CANE BE SEEN ABOVE): 

Person A: the election was fraudulent, widespread voter fraud altered the the results.

Person B: ok where’s the proof? 

Person A: why don’t you prove it didn’t happen? 

THAT IS NOT SIMPLIFIED. That is a paraphrasing of what happened. It is nearly identical to the EXACT scenario that happened above. The meaning is EXACTLY the same.

Make sure you read up on the local laws for residency. Some countries require you to speak the language before you can get residency. Also taxes!

Ended up paying taxes in both countries and then his residency was taken away and he had to come back to the US. He lost his business and had to declare bankruptcy.

"You need to be more clear, you keep interchanging State of the Union and a ""speech to joint congress"" but you are also adamant they are different things. 

Those previous presidents also didn't need to deal with rabid fanatics within their own houses of respective government. 

I'll give you the other big incidents that happened prior to the Joint Sessions speeches. That's fair... However, you still seem to be glossing over a global pandemic that we FINALLY have a vaccine for.

In the cases where parents disagree about it, it can end up in a custody battle. This Texas court case only a custody case. The government isn't forcing anyone to change the gender of their child.This is like saying if a parent loses custody for a child that the government is stealing children.

They don't, and they haven't.  That's what the data has indicated.

Nope.  It has been researched now, and it is objectively true.  You may not like the data, but the data is the data.  Facts are facts.  And the study that was carried out the right way, the one that actually was comparative with a control group, showed us that the masks made no difference in rates of infection in multiple scenarios.  I'm sorry.  I know people like meant well enough in wanting everyone to wear them and that you had every reason to think it was the right approach.  There were plenty of health experts pushing that idea despite not having significant data to support it.  We all thought it was a good thing to do.  But, now that a year has gone by, we have enough data to look at and realize that it wasn't really doing much at all.

"I think you misunderstood my comment. You sort of just repeated what I said. Masks, actual masks like N95 masks or their variants, are designed to protect the wearer. They filter the air the wearer is breathing. That's why we wear masks like this when working with fine particles like sawdust, for example.

Face coverings, like the ones most people wear and call ""masks"", provide some protection from the wearer spreading their droplets everywhere--thereby protecting those around them if the wearer sick. That's why Asian countries have been encouraging sick people to wear these kinds of face coverings for a long time now: it decreases the spread of the illness because the sick person can't cough out as many sickness-causing droplets.

In other words, a mask protects the wearer through filtration.

"Problem is that you have no data to support your claims.  There is no data substantiating the claim that masks slowed seasonal flu because year to year seasonal flu infection rates vary wildly.  Also, many flu cases likely went undiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to COVID protocols.

Plus, the mask thing is now proving to be a wholly arbitrary thing that isn't based on data at all.  The double and triple mask idea showed us that.  It was tossed out there with no supporting data whatsoever, and the idea is so absurd and unnecessary that even surgery centers don't do anything of the sort.

Mask mandates were put in place out of good intentions.  But now that there is data to show they have had no meaningful impact on infection rates, maintaining them is not based on good intentions.

"You have to consider trends of infections as well. Masks and distancing and staying home was working until May/June when places started opening up and cases went up. It eventually leveled out and with continued urging of these practices, cases started going down again. But then you have events like July 4th, Labor Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year which cause larger spikes. You can see that in between Labor day and Halloween, cases started to go back down, but remember that they are having to trend down from a higher starting point. Since New Years, at least in Texas, cases have steadily gone down and we've been doing good. However, in all these time periods where cases spike up so quickly, it gives the virus more time to mutate and develop into new strains. Moreover, our vaccination rate is poor and there are a disproportionate amount of doses going to smaller/rural areas vs more urban areas.

"Good idea, although I'm centre-Right and not a Trump sycophant. I personally wouldn't support Trump in 2024, although I do admit he was better than Biden in 2020. My reasoning being that during a time of crisis, he ran the country in the same way as he ran his businesses - taking a lot of debt, which a fiscal conservative shouldn't do unless it leads to long term growth of GDP. My impression of Parler from the media is that it's full of Trump sycophants, although I have realized I shouldn't trust the media. So I'll give it a shot.

I wouldn't even be Centre-Right regarding the social issues, but the Left has gone into the deep end of Lefty lunacy with their 'Critical Race Theory' and doesn't even believe in sensible economics anymore with their 'Socialism' and 'Modern Monetary Theory'. And don't get me started on this 'political correctness' BS. It's utter nonsense and a symptom of the Left's 'inclusivity' and 'diversity', where they aren't even open to having discussions regarding issues such as Islamic extremism, transgenders in sports etc and they just label everyone a racist or something similar because they cannot defend their points with facts and logic. 

They are illiberal to be honest, and I hope to change the minds of the few sane Lefties left to Right side by giving the perspective of an outsider. I have seen politics being a s\*\*\*show everywhere, but America is the motherload of all s\*\*\*shows, especially in the last 12 years.

"Not at all. You’re inverting the logic, just like every person with cognitive dissonance nowadays. You eat food to feed yourself, not others. You wear clothes to keep yourself warm, not others. In a possible airplane crash, you put a oxygen mask on yourself first, then on the child next to you. On the other hand, no masks can isolate anyone from a virus (only a Hazmat suit can). The premise that I-95 will “filter” the air to “protect” others is the biggest lie ever told in “scientific” talk. The main reason people would wear masks in the medical field is due to saliva projectiles being stopped from landing on patients during medical procedures. There has never been one single peer reviewed study in which face masks show evidence on blocking viruses from those who wear it. What face masks give people is a sense of security. That’s why those who believe wearing a face diaper will keep them safer, let them do their thing. People shouldn’t be forced to wear them. Period. Now, you get a free pass to wear double masks all day, even at home. No wait! How about triple face masking? How does that sound? On no! I forgot, you want others to wear them too, don’t you? I see!

"Dude, watch the video before you say there is no evidence. Steven Crowder said on record he would testify in court under threat of perjury. His own team went to the actual locations. This is literal factual information. Just because it didn't come from one of your ""reputable"" sources does not mean it is not evidence. This is actual evidence of voter irregularities and you should, as a voting citizen, want your vote to matter. Watch the video before you say YouTube isn't reputable that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. YouTube has been trying to censor this guy for ages and he actually went to YouTube with this evidence and they told him that it was okay to post because it was his own verified evidence. Table your preconceived notions and look at an individuals personal and verifiable experience. You'll never find the evidence if you refuse to accept the basic truths

The truths being:

Steven Crowder's Team went to these addresses and there were no residents, let alone buildings in these locations 

The addresses were changed on Tuesday night after Crowder's show.

The county only inputs addresses and makes changes on Monday's (per their website)

One of the addresses was a Hillary Clinton staffer who has gone missing and her address was registered as an empty lot and has sense been changed to an apartment building

Crowder's team followed up with this new address and she still did not have residence in the building the voter registration information sent them to

This is all undeniable evidence that there were vote irregularities at the very least.

You may say these were procedural mistakes, however there were multiple and the data was changed after. You tell me how that looks. 

You may also say these were homeless voters. This also is not true because the procedure for homeless voters is to put your address as ""0 \*followed by the cross streets they spend most their time\*"" 

These addresses were specifically numbered along with the street names.

To say this alone changed the election I cannot say.

However, these \~50 names they checked wiped 50 legitimate Nevada votes.

Any decent citizen would at least want these errors to be looked at properly to avoid them in the future. Instead we sit under the false notion that there was ""absolutely no election fraud"" 

The left was calling for completely Russia investigation. Who's to say those names were not added maliciously from Russia or China?

"Aw, apnews.com isn't biased. It is only biased (it is centered-biased) because it destroys all the lies. 

Youtube, really? A website is known to have user-created material and is known to be unreliable. 

So, I have another person unable to provide undisputed evidence. 

You don't like apnews.com because none of your material will appear on the website. After all, it doesn't write lies. 

apnews.com, thehill.com, reuters.com, or all of these will work. 

Deflection, projection, and gaslighting. Good endeavor. 

The mere fact that none of you can provide significant evidence is astonishing. I would have thought someone out of 166,126 members would have some legitimate sources of evidence. 

Let me know when you have reliable sources. I am weeding out those who can't tell the difference between lies and factual (truthful). 

Here is a fact:

On January 6th, 2021, Trump supporters attacked the capitol on beliefs the elections were stolen without evidence to back up such claims. They genuinely believed attacking the capitol would ensure their leader, Donald J. Trump, would still be president. However, they failed their terrorist (coup) attack on the country and ensured their master's leadership would prevail. 

This statement has more facts than the previous messages with the accusations of ""evidence"" for an imaginary event. 

Provide me substantial evidence that would prove there is election fraud, and I may believe in the event happening. Otherwise, it did not happen as no evidence is present. 

Imagine this as a courtroom. NO evidence means no case. As for now, there is no case because no evidence is present.

I think a larger majority than the left sided internet is all for the mandate ending, but also cautious. 

My opinion is pretty simple: thank god we now have the choice and thank god business can re-open with pointless restrictions.

"Wait, let me see if I understand your remark. 

I am ignorant because I ask for factual sources that provide evidence? So, you are admitting that you lack the ability to provide such evidence based on facts? 

I mean, using ""pro-trump"" and YouTube does not constitution factual sources. 

Undeniable (*adjective*) is unable to be denied or disputed.

I don't see anything representing any of that sort in the so-called ""evidence."" I see a lot of disputable content. 

The mere fact that you think ""apnews.com"" isn't factual is hilarious, considering they ""verify"" the content before posting. Want to find out if I am lying? Search something that CNN or a pro-left writes and see if they match. 

Not sorry that I won't listen to anything that can't be cross-referenced. Simplicity at its finest is providing sources, but all I am hearing is excuses and deflection. 

You are admitting there is no significant evidence of election fraud. You didn't read a single thing I stated. 

&gt;If you deflect, gaslight, project, or insult, then you admit I am speaking facts. 

You went ahead and done so. An ultimatum if you say.

Yeah, 90% of that site is full of questionable sources, and I am supposed to believe they are legitimate. Want to show me that they are factual, then provide factual sources. Otherwise, I won't accept anything that isn't factual. Not a hard concept that even a high-school kid would understand. 

I am astonished how a few terminologies are lacking within this sub. 

I don't know what was hard to comprehend, but I did clarify what I was expecting, but so many failed to provide such evidence. 

I stated that I am looking for undeniable, substantial, undisputable, and conclusive evidence from factual sources. I did not want sources that are Pro-Trump.

Actual Evidence: Steven crowder has been going to addresses registered suspiciously. His team has gone to around 30 I believe. The locations registered were empty lots with no residents. One of the people they looked into was a staffer for Hillary Clinton, she is currently missing. They found where she was registered to vote and went to the location. The location was an empty lot. The address was changed the day after Steven Crowder showed the evidence. They have full receipts of this and its very suspicious. They changed voter registration after the fact on a Tuesday night and the county website says procedurally they only change entries on Mondays. This is obviously the most insignificant evidence but even this is quite damming, considering they were changing the addresses after. This could either be people intentionally trying to cover their sloppy work, or Russian, or Chinese assets.

"There should be term limits on Congress, there should be **NO** pension to members of Congress, they are not federal employees and should never have gotten a pension.

The President is a special case who ends up requiring Secret Service protection for the rest of his/her life and likely not able to work a *job* after holding office.

Likewise there should be term limits on the Judiciary, zero lifetime appointments.  

My thoughts on the changes would be:

* President: change to one 6 year term so the sitting President works through his whole term and doesn't worry about the optics for re-election.
* House: Maximum of five 2 year terms, no more than 10 years in House.
* Senate: Maximum of two 4 year terms (down from 6), no more than 8 years in the Senate.
* Maybe maximum of no more than 12 years total in Congress in any combination of House and Senate.

Why do we have taxes on people equally like we are all equally paid?

Next up is interest rates... Can somebody smarter than me help me understand why poorer people have to pay higher interest rates because they are poor? Of course we'd all have A1 credit if we had lots of money. So because you have lots of money you get things at a lower monthly cost than we do so you get to keep more of your money.

"Tax cuts benefited everyone. You may not have directly ""seen"" the impacts of the tax cut. But tax cuts boosted the economy and employment was doing great until covid hit. That's the dumbed down description of what the tax cuts did.

Making college free only benefits academics. On average someone with a bachelor's degree makes double the average income.

""Poor people can't afford college"" isn't a valid excuse. You simply get debt and pay it off later. The current system is super rewarding for poor people.

Getting a bachelor's degree is a guaranteed way to go from lower class to middle class. I would know, I was poor until I got my bachelors. I worked throughout school to help pay, and with my first graduate job I devoted as much as I could to paying it all off until my debt was gone.
